## 🔧 Technical Details

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
  id: "pet_1234567890_abc123def",
  timestamp: 1696723200000,
  account: "Main Account",
  petKey: "bee_001",
  petName: "Busy Bee",
  age: 50,
  currentWeight: 75,
  mutation: "golden",
  loanedTo: "PlayerName",
  weightAt100: 125,  // Calculated
  sizeClass: 12,     // Calculated
  rank: 3            // Calculated
}
```

### Calculations

#### Weight at 100
```javascript
weightAt100 = currentWeight + (100 - age)
```
Assumes linear growth of 1kg per day.

#### Size Class
```javascript
sizeClass = Math.floor(weightAt100 / 10)
```

#### Pet Rank
Pets are grouped by `petKey` (pet type), then sorted by `weightAt100` in ascending order. Rank 1 is the lowest weight at 100 for that pet type.

### Storage
- Uses `localStorage` with key: `gagPets_petInventory`
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Maximum storage depends on browser (typically 5-10MB)

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge: Full support
- Firefox: Full support
- Safari: Full support
- Mobile browsers: Responsive design with horizontal scroll for table

## 🐛 Known Issues
None at this time.

## 📝 Notes
- Weight at 100 calculation assumes linear growth (1kg/day) which may not match actual game mechanics
- Pet rank is per pet type, not global
- Loaned pets are highlighted in yellow for easy identification
- All mutations from the main pet calculator are supported
- Dark mode preference is shared across all pages

## 🎉 Summary
The Pet Tracker is a fully functional inventory management system that integrates seamlessly with the existing Grow a Garden pet calculator. It provides a clean, intuitive interface for tracking multiple pets across multiple accounts with sorting, filtering, and data export/import capabilities.
