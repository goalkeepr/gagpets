# Docker Compose Compatibility Guide

## ✅ Dockerfile + compose.yaml Compatibility

Your `Dockerfile` and `compose.yaml` are now fully compatible and optimized for the screenshot API.

### Key Compatibility Features

#### **Dockerfile Optimizations:**
- ✅ Chrome dependencies installed
- ✅ Puppeteer Chrome installation 
- ✅ Proper user permissions for non-root execution
- ✅ Puppeteer cache configuration
- ✅ Health check endpoint

#### **compose.yaml Optimizations:**
- ✅ Uses `build: .` to build from Dockerfile
- ✅ `shm_size: 1gb` for Chrome performance
- ✅ `security_opt: seccomp:unconfined` for Chrome compatibility
- ✅ Proper port mapping (8029:8029)
- ✅ Development environment configuration

## 🚀 Usage Commands

### Start the application:
```bash
docker compose up
```

### Start in background:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### View logs:
```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

### Stop the application:
```bash
docker compose down
```

### Rebuild and restart:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## 🧪 Testing the Setup

### Automatic verification:
```bash
./verify-compose.sh
```

### Manual testing:
```bash
# Start the service
docker compose up -d

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8029/health

# Test screenshot API
curl "http://localhost:8029/api/pets/trex/screenshot" -o test.png

# Clean up
docker compose down
```

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Shared Memory (shm_size)
- **Purpose**: Chrome requires adequate shared memory for proper operation
- **Setting**: `1gb` for development (sufficient for screenshot generation)
- **Impact**: Prevents Chrome crashes and improves performance

### Security Options (seccomp:unconfined)
- **Purpose**: Allows Chrome to run with necessary system calls
- **Setting**: `seccomp:unconfined` removes seccomp restrictions
- **Impact**: Enables Chrome to function properly in containerized environment

### Environment Variables
- **NODE_ENV=development**: Enables development mode
- **PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR**: Set in Dockerfile for proper cache location

## 🎯 Expected Results

When you run `docker compose up`, you should see:
1. ✅ Image builds successfully with Chrome installation
2. ✅ Container starts and binds to port 8029
3. ✅ Health check passes at `/health` endpoint
4. ✅ Screenshot API works at `/api/pets/:petKey/screenshot`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If build fails:
- Ensure Docker has enough memory (recommend 4GB+)
- Check internet connection for Chrome download
- Try `docker compose build --no-cache`

### If Chrome errors occur:
- Verify shared memory setting (`shm_size: 1gb`)
- Check security options (`seccomp:unconfined`)
- Review container logs: `docker compose logs`

### If screenshot API fails:
- Check if Chrome was installed properly in build logs
- Verify Puppeteer cache permissions
- Test health endpoint first to ensure app is running
