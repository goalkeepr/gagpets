## Implementation Details

### Data Structure
All pets follow the established pattern:
```javascript
petkey: {
    name: "Pet Name",
    icon: { type: "image", url: "...", fallback: "emoji" },
    type: "animal_type",
    rarity: "Rarity",
    source: "Spooky Egg",
    probability: X,
    obtainable: true,
    description: "Brief description",
    calculate: (kg, modifierType = "none") => { /* calculation logic */ },
    perKgImpact: () => "Impact description"
}
```

### Key Features
- **Modifier support:** All pets support mutations via `getModifierDetails()`
- **Weight validation:** Uses `Utils.isValidWeight()` for input checking
- **Time formatting:** Uses `Utils.formatTime()` for consistent display
- **HTML output:** Returns formatted strings with styling
- **Constraints:** Proper min/max values using `Math.max()` and `Math.min()`

### Time Calculations
All time-based calculations use **SECONDS** internally:
- Base cooldowns stored in seconds
- Modifier calculations in seconds
- `Utils.formatTime()` converts to human-readable format (e.g., "4m 8s")

### Special Implementation: Headless Horseman
- Uses HTML `<font>` tags with hex colors for visual drama
- Multiple colored text elements for different mutation types
- Unicode character (\\226\\128\\148) for em dash separator

## Testing Results

### Module Loading Test
```bash
âœ… Spooky Egg pets loaded: 5
  - Bat (Uncommon)
  - Bone Dog (Rare)
  - Spider (Legendary)
  - Black Cat (Mythical)
  - Headless Horseman (Prismatic)
```

### Calculation Tests
```bash
âœ… Spider at 50kg: 
Every 4m 8s, weaves a 27.0 stud web that lasts for 15s. 
Pets on the web advance cooldown an extra 1.50s every second 
& plants grow an additional 22.5s every second!

âœ… Headless Horseman at 50kg:
Every 20m 44s, haunts a random level 30.0 pet without a mutation, 
resetting it to level 1 and bestowing one of four chaotic mutations
```

### Pet Count Statistics
- **Total pets:** 198 (was 193, added 5)
- **Total categories:** 29 (was 28, added 1)
- **Spooky Egg pets:** 5

## Frontend Integration
All frontend elements are already in place:
- âœ… Mobile filter dropdown includes Spooky Egg
- âœ… Desktop filter buttons include Spooky Egg
- âœ… Source icon URL mapped
- âœ… Emoji fallback (ðŸ‘») configured
- âœ… Known sources array updated

## Development Server
Server successfully started on port 8029:
```bash
ðŸŒ± Pet Calculator Server running on port 8029
ðŸ“± Access the application at http://localhost:8029
ðŸ”§ Health check available at http://localhost:8029/health
```

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Create pet data file (`spookyEgg.js`)
2. âœ… Integrate into module system (`petAbilities_modular.js`)
3. âœ… Update frontend filters (`pets.html`)
4. âœ… Test module loading
5. âœ… Test pet calculations
6. âœ… Verify frontend integration
7. ðŸŽ‰ **COMPLETE!**

## Notes
- The Spooky Egg icon URL points to: `https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/growagarden/images/c/c5/Spooky_Egg.png`
- All pets use consistent scaling patterns with the existing pet system
- Probability percentages add up to 97%, leaving 3% for other outcomes (consistent with other eggs)
- The Headless Horseman introduces "undead" as a new animal type
