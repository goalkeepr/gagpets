Apply the stylesheet and dark mode toggle from pets.html to recipes.html

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you apply the stylesheet and dark mode toggle from `pets.html` to recipes.html. Let me first examine both files to understand the current structure and what needs to be transferred. Now let me read the current `recipes.html` file to see what needs to be updated: I can see that the `recipes.html` file has some structural issues and is missing the dark mode toggle and proper stylesheet reference. Let me create a plan to apply the necessary changes: Let me start by fixing the head section structure: 
```

```
Now I need to add the additional recipe-specific styles: 
```

```
I need to properly close the style tag. Let me add the dark mode toggle button to the header first: 
```

```
Now let me add the dark mode JavaScript functionality: 
```

```
Now let me update the CSS section to properly close the embedded styles and ensure proper styling: Let me check the current structure of the file around the styles section: Let me find where the CSS section ends: Perfect! Now I can see the structure. The CSS is already properly closed. Let me complete the final todo item: Perfect! I have successfully applied the stylesheet and dark mode toggle from `pets.html` to recipes.html. Here's a summary of what was implemented:
