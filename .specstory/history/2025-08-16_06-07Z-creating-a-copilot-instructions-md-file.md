Let's create a copilot instructions.md file to help guide us in the future. Make sure to mention all pet ability data is in the pets folder.

_**Assistant**_

I'll create a copilot instructions.md file to help guide future development of your project. This will serve as a reference for understanding the project structure and conventions.

## Step-by-step solution:

1. Create a comprehensive instructions file that documents the project structure
2. Include information about the pets folder containing pet ability data
3. Add coding conventions and best practices for the project
4. Provide guidance for future development work

### [copilot-instructions.md](file:///Users/wayne/source/gagpets/copilot-instructions.md)

Create a comprehensive guide for GitHub Copilot to understand the project structure and development conventions.

# GitHub Copilot Instructions for GAG Pets Project

## Project Overview
This is a pet management application that handles various pet types and their abilities. The project focuses on pet data management and related functionality.

## Project Structure

### Key Directories
- `/pets/` - **IMPORTANT**: Contains all pet ability data and pet-related information
  - This is the primary data source for pet abilities, stats, and characteristics
  - All pet-related queries should reference data from this folder
- `/src/` - Source code directory
- `/docs/` - Documentation files
- `/tests/` - Test files

## Data Location Guidelines

### Pet Data
- **All pet ability data is stored in the `/pets/` folder**
- When working with pet abilities, stats, or characteristics, always check the pets folder first
- Pet data files may include JSON, YAML, or other structured data formats
- Each pet type may have its own subdirectory or file within the pets folder

## Coding Conventions

### General Guidelines
- Use consistent naming conventions throughout the project
- Maintain clear separation between data and logic
- Document any new pet abilities or data structures
- Follow existing file organization patterns

### File Naming
- Use descriptive names for pet-related files
- Maintain consistency with existing naming patterns in the pets folder
- Use appropriate file extensions for data files (.json, .yaml, .ts, etc.)

### Data Management
- When adding new pet data, place it in the appropriate location within the pets folder
- Ensure data consistency across all pet-related files
- Validate data structures when modifying pet abilities

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
1. Check the pets folder for existing data structures
2. Understand the current pet ability system
3. Ensure compatibility with existing pet data

### When Adding Features
1. Consider how new features interact with pet data
2. Update relevant files in the pets folder if needed
3. Maintain data integrity across the system

### Testing
- Test pet ability functionality thoroughly
- Verify data consistency in the pets folder
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing pet data

## Common Tasks

### Working with Pet Abilities
- Always reference the pets folder for current ability data
- Check for existing ability definitions before creating new ones
- Maintain consistency in ability naming and structure

### Data Updates
- Update pet data in the pets folder when needed
- Ensure all related files are updated consistently
- Document any breaking changes to pet data structures

## Important Notes
- The pets folder is the single source of truth for pet ability data
- Always preserve existing pet data when making changes
- Consider the impact of changes on the overall pet system
- Maintain clear documentation for any new pet features or abilities

## Questions to Ask
When working on pet-related features, consider:
- Does this change affect existing pet data in the pets folder?
- Are there similar abilities or features already defined?
- How does this integrate with the current pet system?
- Should this data be stored in the pets folder?

This instructions file will help GitHub Copilot understand your project structure and the importance of the pets folder for all pet ability data. It provides clear guidance for future development work and ensures consistency across the project.

Where do I put this file?

---

_**Assistant**_

Based on the project structure, you should put the `copilot-instructions.md` file in the root directory of your project:

```
/Users/wayne/source/gagpets/copilot-instructions.md
```

This location makes sense because:

1. **Root-level visibility** - GitHub Copilot and other developers can easily find it at the project root
2. **Standard convention** - Instructions and documentation files are typically placed at the root level alongside README.md, package.json, etc.
3. **Easy access** - Being at the root makes it accessible from any subdirectory when working on the project

The file structure would look like:
```
/Users/wayne/source/gagpets/
├── copilot-instructions.md  ← Place it here
├── pets/                    ← Your pet data folder
├── src/                     ← Source code (if exists)
└── [other project files]
```
