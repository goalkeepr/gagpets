I'll help you update the pet abilities in the `petAbilities.js` file. First, let me read the current file to understand its structure and then make the requested changes. Let me continue reading the file to see more pets and find the ones I need to modify: Now let me find the specific pets I need to modify by searching for them: Now I'll make the updates one by one. Let me start with Nihonzaru: Let me check the exact content around Nihonzaru to see the proper format: I see that Nihonzaru is already updated with the correct values (Boost Max: 6, Boost Base: 2, Boost per kg: 0.10). Let me check the Corrupted Kodama: I need to update Corrupted Kodama: 
```

```
Now let me check and update Deer: I need to update Deer to change the Chance Max to 5: 
```

```
Now let me check and update Spotted Deer: I need to update Spotted Deer to change the Chance Max to 10: 
```

```
Now let me check and update Axolotl: I need to update Axolotl to change the Chance Max to 13 and Chance per kg to 0.20: 
```

```
Now let me check and update Mole: I need to update Mole to change the Cooldown Min to 10 and Cooldown per kg to -1: 
```

```
Finally, let me check and update regular Kodama: I need to update regular Kodama to change the Chance Max to 12, Chance Base to 6, and Chance per kg to 0.33: 
```

```
Now I need to check if there are any "* Not Pet-Specific" entries that need the Cooldown Min changed from 1,200 to 1,000. Let me search for these: Let me check these areas to see if they are related to the "* Not Pet-Specific" entries: Perfect! I found the "* Not Pet-Specific" entries - they're the pet mutations at the end of the file. These are Radiant Pet Mutation, Ascended Pet Mutation, and Corrupted Pet Mutation. I need to update all three to change the cooldown minimum from 1200 to 1000: 
```

```
Let me check the exact text for the Ascended Pet Mutation: I see, let me find the correct Ascended Pet Mutation and Tranquil Pet Mutation: Let me check the Tranquil Pet Mutation: Now let me update the Tranquil Pet Mutation: Let me be more specific: 
```

```
Now let me update the Corrupted Pet Mutation: 
```

```
