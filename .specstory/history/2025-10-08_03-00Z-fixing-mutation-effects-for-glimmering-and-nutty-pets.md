# Fixing mutation effects for glimmering and nutty pets (2025-10-08 03:00Z)

_**User (2025-10-08 03:04Z)**_

There are no mutation effects displayed for glimmering or nutty mutations.

I'll investigate the mutation effects issue for glimmering and nutty mutations. Let me first check the mutations data file and the modifiers utility to understand how mutations are implemented. Now let me check the `pets.html` file more carefully to see how the mutation descriptions are being displayed. Looking at the screenshot, I can see the mutations dropdown and the mutation effect should be shown somewhere below. Let me search for where mutations are displayed: Good! I can see the mutation mapping is already in the HTML file. Now let me read the specific section around line 298-320 to see the full implementation: Perfect! I can see the mutation map in `pets.html` includes both 'glimmering' and 'nutty' mutations (lines 310 and 312). Now let me check the modifier dropdown options to see if they're included there: Great! The dropdown options include both glimmering and nutty. Now let me check the `modifiers.js` file again to see if these mutations have entries in the `getModifierDetails` function. I saw earlier they do exist. Let me verify where the mutation descriptions get displayed: Now let me read the actual display sections to see how mutations are shown: Perfect! Now let me check the `getPetMutationDescription` method in the Calculator object: Now let me check if the `global_bridge.js` is properly loading the mutations. Let me read that file: Now let me check the `petAbilities_modular.js` file to see if mutations are properly exported: Let me read the full `getPetMutationDescription` function from `petAbilities_modular.js`: Found it! The issue is in the `mutationMap` in `petAbilities_modular.js` at line 109-123. The map is **missing** the 'luminous' and 'nutty' mutations! They exist in the `mutations.js` file and in the `pets.html` file, but they're not in the mutation map in `petAbilities_modular.js`.

Let me fix this by adding the missing mutations to the map: 
```

```
Perfect! Now I also need to check if there's a `getModifierDetails` function in `modifiers.js` that needs the 'glimmering' entry. Let me verify: Good! I can see that `modifiers.js` already has entries for 'luminous' and 'nutty' (lines 43-46). However, I notice that 'glimmering' is **missing** from the `getModifierDetails` function! Let me add it: 
```

```
Excellent! Now let me also check the `getPetMutationDescription` function in `modifiers.js` to ensure it has the complete mutation map: Perfect! The `modifiers.js` file already has the complete mutation map including 'glimmering', 'luminous', and 'nutty'. Now let me verify the changes and test the server: The server is already running. Let me check if there are any other places where the mutation map needs to be updated. Let me also verify the compare mode modifiers in `pets.html`: Great! The HTML dropdowns already have all the mutations including glimmering, luminous, and nutty. Now let me create a simple test to verify the mutations are working: Perfect! The mutations are now working correctly. Let me verify the complete flow by checking the debug endpoint. Since the server is already running, let me open the browser to test: Great! Now let me create a summary of the changes made:

## Summary

I've fixed the issue with glimmering and nutty mutation effects not being displayed. The problem was that these mutations were missing from the mutation mapping in some files. Here's what I fixed:

### Changes Made:

1. **`petAbilities_modular.js`** - Added missing mutation entries:
   - Added `'luminous': 'Luminous Pet Mutation'` to the mutation map
   - Added `'nutty': 'Nutty Pet Mutation'` to the mutation map
   - Note: 'glimmering' was already present here

2. **`modifiers.js`** - Added missing glimmering modifier:
   - Added the `'glimmering'` case to the `getModifierDetails()` function with the correct color styling (`color: rgb(255, 215, 0)`)
   - Note: 'luminous' and 'nutty' were already present here

### What Was Already Working:
- ✅ `mutations.js` - Contains all mutation definitions including glimmering, luminous, and nutty
- ✅ `pets.html` - Dropdown options include all mutations
- ✅ `pets.html` - Inline mutation map includes all mutations
- ✅ `modifiers.js` - The async `getPetMutationDescription()` function had the complete map

### Testing:
I tested the mutations with a 50kg pet and confirmed:
- **Glimmering**: "Every 22m 30s, a nearby fruit begins to glimmer, applying the Glimmering mutation with 21.50% success rate!"
- **Nutty**: "Every 10m, the pet's next ability use has a 25.00% chance to activate twice. Otherwise, this pet loses a level."

The mutations should now display correctly when selected in the Pet Mutation dropdown on the calculator page. Simply refresh the page in your browser to see the changes take effect!

Update copilot-instructions.md to address adding new pet mutations.

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll update the `copilot-instructions.md` file to include comprehensive guidance on adding new pet mutations. Let me first read the current file to understand its structure: Now I'll add a comprehensive section on adding new pet mutations to the `copilot-instructions.md` file:
