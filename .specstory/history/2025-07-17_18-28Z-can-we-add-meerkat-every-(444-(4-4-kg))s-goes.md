# Can we add Meerkat? Every (444 - (4.4 * kg))s goes (2025-07-17 18:28Z)

_**User**_

Can we add Meerkat? Every (444 - (4.4 * kg))s goes to another pet and does a lookout. That pet advances cooldown by (20 + 0.5 * kg)s! Has a (15 + (kg / 4))% chance to do it again after each lookout.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add a Meerkat to your pets system. First, let me examine the current file to understand the structure and then add the Meerkat with the specifications you provided. I can see this is a comprehensive pet ability calculator for a "Grow a Garden" game. Now I'll add the Meerkat with the specifications you provided. Let me add it to the `petAbilities` object with the proper calculations. 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully added the Meerkat to your pet calculator with the exact specifications you provided:

ü¶¶ **Meerkat Features:**
- **Lookout Interval**: Every (444 - (4.4 * kg)) seconds
- **Cooldown Advance**: Advances target pet's cooldown by (20 + 0.5 * kg) seconds
- **Repeat Chance**: (15 + (kg / 4))% chance to do another lookout after each one

The Meerkat has been added to the pet abilities with:
- Icon: ü¶¶ (otter emoji as a close representation)
- Type: "mammal"
- Description: "Does lookouts that advance other pets' cooldowns"
- Full calculation formula matching your specifications
- Per-kg impact information showing how each additional kilogram affects the abilities

The pet will now appear in the dropdown menu alphabetically sorted with all the other pets, and users can calculate its abilities at different weights just like the other pets. The calculator will show both the single weight calculations and comparison mode for the Meerkat.

Ankylosaurus: When another player steals fruit from you, grants a (15.7 + (kg / 4))% chance you get the stolen fruit as well!

Axolotl: (6 + (0.3 * kg))% chance Summer type fruit stays after collecting!

Bear Bee:  Every (1510 - (16 * kg)) seconds, goes to a nearby fruit and tries to pollinate it - but it's not a bee so it fails and turns it to Honey Glazed instead!

_**Assistant**_

I'll add these five new pets to your calculator. I notice that Meerkat is already in the system, so I'll update it with the corrected formula and add the other four new pets. 
```

```
Now I need to remove the old Meerkat entry since I've updated it with the corrected formula. Let me find and remove the duplicate: Let me search for the old meerkat entry in the HTML file to remove it: I can see there are two meerkat entries. Let me remove the old one that's likely around line 808: I can see the old meerkat entry with the incorrect formula (0.5 * kg instead of kg / 2). Let me remove this old entry: 
```
