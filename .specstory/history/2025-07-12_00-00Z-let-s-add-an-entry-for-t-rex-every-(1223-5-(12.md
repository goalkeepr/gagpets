# Let's add an entry for T-Rex: Every (1223.5 - (12  (2025-07-12 00:00Z)

_**User**_

Let's add an entry for T-Rex: Every (1223.5 - (12 * kg)) seconds, devours a random mutation from your garden, then spreads it to (3 + (kg / 5)) other random fruits in your garden!

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add the T-Rex entry to the pet abilities data in your HTML file. Let me add it to the `petAbilities` object. 
```

```
Perfect! I've added the T-Rex entry to your pet abilities data. The T-Rex has been configured with:

- **Name**: T-Rex
- **Icon**: ðŸ¦– (T-Rex emoji)
- **Type**: dinosaur
- **Description**: "Devours and spreads mutations throughout the garden"
- **Ability**: Every (1223.5 - (12 * kg)) seconds, devours a random mutation from your garden, then spreads it to (3 + (kg / 5)) other random fruits in your garden

The T-Rex will now appear in the dropdown menu along with the other pets, and users can calculate its abilities based on different weights. The calculation follows the same format as the other pets, showing the time interval and the number of target fruits based on the pet's weight.

Let's add Red Fox: Every (442.33 - (5 * kg)) seconds, goes to another players random crop and tries to get a seed from it. Rarer seeds have lower chance to succeed!

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add the Red Fox entry to the pet abilities data. Let me add it after the T-Rex entry. 
```

```
Perfect! I've added the Red Fox entry to your pet abilities data. The Red Fox has been configured with:

- **Name**: Red Fox
- **Icon**: ðŸ¦Š (fox emoji)
- **Type**: mammal
- **Description**: "Steals seeds from other players' crops"
- **Ability**: Every (442.33 - (5 * kg)) seconds, goes to another player's random crop and tries to get a seed from it. Rarer seeds have lower chance to succeed!

The Red Fox will now appear in the dropdown menu along with the other pets, and users can calculate its seed-stealing abilities based on different weights. The calculation shows how the time interval decreases as the pet gets heavier, making it more efficient at stealing seeds from other players.

Next, add Butterfly: Every (1807.4-(18*kg)) seconds, flies to a nearby fruit with 5+ mutations, removes all of them, and turns it rainbow! Ignores favorited fruit.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add the Butterfly entry to the pet abilities data. Let me add it after the Red Fox entry. 
```

```
Perfect! I've added the Butterfly entry to your pet abilities data. The Butterfly has been configured with:

- **Name**: Butterfly
- **Icon**: ðŸ¦‹ (butterfly emoji)
- **Type**: insect
- **Description**: "Transforms heavily mutated fruits into rainbow fruits"
- **Ability**: Every (1807.4 - (18 * kg)) seconds, flies to a nearby fruit with 5+ mutations, removes all of them, and turns it rainbow! Ignores favorited fruit.

The Butterfly will now appear in the dropdown menu along with the other pets, and users can calculate its mutation-clearing abilities based on different weights. The calculation shows how the time interval decreases significantly as the pet gets heavier (18 seconds per kg), making it much more efficient at finding and transforming heavily mutated fruits into rainbow fruits.
