# Changing kgLimits property to a constant (2025-09-17 22:28Z)

_**User (2025-09-17 22:29Z)**_

Change the kgLimits property to a const.
Here is an example implementation:
```
    bagelbunny: {
        name: "Bagel Bunny",
        icon: {
            type: "image",
            url: "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/growagarden/images/5/51/BagelBunny.png",
            fallback: "ðŸ¥¯"
        },
        type: "herbivore",
        rarity: "Legendary",
        source: "Gourmet Egg",
        probability: 50,
        obtainable: true,
        description: "Eats carrots for enhanced value bonuses",
        calculate: (kg, modifierType = "none") => {
            if (!Utils.isValidWeight(kg)) return "Invalid weight";
            
            const { value: modifier, text: modifierText, style: modifierStyle } = getModifierDetails(modifierType);
            const kgLimits = "Cooldown Min: 40.00 (31.00 ðŸŒˆ)";
            
            const baseCooldown = 45;
            const cooldownMod = baseCooldown * modifier;
            const adjustedBaseCooldown = baseCooldown - cooldownMod;
            const cooldown = Math.max(5, adjustedBaseCooldown - kg);
            const multiplier = 5 + (0.05 * kg);
            
            const multiplierMod = 5 * modifier;
            const multiplierTotal = multiplier + multiplierMod;
            
            const displayText = modifier > 0 ? ` <span style='${modifierStyle}'>${modifierText}</span>` : "";
            
            return `Every <strong>${Utils.formatTime(cooldown)}</strong>, eats a carrot for <strong>${multiplierTotal.toFixed(2)}x</strong> value bonus${displayText}!`;
        },
        perKgImpact: () => "Each additional kg decreases cooldown by 1 second and increases value bonus by 0.05x"
    },
```

I'll help you change the `kgLimits` property to a `const` in the zenEgg.js file. Let me first read the current file to see the existing implementation. Now I can see the structure of the `zenEgg.js` file. I need to change all instances of `kgLimits` properties to be `const` declarations instead. Looking at the file, I can see that `shibainu`, `tanuki`, and `kappa` have `kgLimits` properties. Following the example you provided, I'll convert these to `const` declarations within their respective `calculate` functions. 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully converted all the `kgLimits` properties in the `zenEgg.js` file to `const` declarations within their respective `calculate` functions. Here's what was changed:

1. **shibainu**: Moved `kgLimits: "Min Digging Cooldown: 55.00 (43.00 ðŸŒˆ)"` from being a property of the pet object to a `const kgLimits = "Min Digging Cooldown: 55.00 (43.00 ðŸŒˆ)"` declaration inside the `calculate` function.

2. **tanuki**: Moved `kgLimits: "Min Mischief Time: 55.00 (40.00 ðŸŒˆ)"` from being a property to a `const` declaration inside the `calculate` function.

3. **kappa**: Moved `kgLimits: "Min Spray Time: 107.00 (82.60 ðŸŒˆ)"` from being a property to a `const` declaration inside the `calculate` function.

The changes follow the exact pattern you provided in your example, where the `kgLimits` information is now defined as a `const` within each pet's `calculate` function, making it available for use within those functions while removing it as a direct property of the pet objects.

Fix this file too

I'll check the uncommonEgg.js file and fix any `kgLimits` properties by converting them to `const` declarations within the `calculate` functions. I can see that the `uncommonEgg.js` file has three pets with `kgLimits` properties that need to be converted to `const` declarations: `cat`, `deer`, and `blackbunny`. I'll fix all of them at once. 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully fixed the `uncommonEgg.js` file by converting all the `kgLimits` properties to `const` declarations within their respective `calculate` functions. Here's what was changed:

1. **cat**: Moved the complex `kgLimits: "Nap Interval Min: 75.00 (59.00 ðŸŒˆ), Nap Duration Max: 100.00 (100.00 ðŸŒˆ), Range Max: 100.00 (100.00 ðŸŒˆ)"` from being a property to a `const` declaration inside the `calculate` function.

2. **deer**: Moved `kgLimits: "Max Preservation Chance: 30.00 (28.00 ðŸŒˆ)"` from being a property to a `const` declaration inside the `calculate` function.

3. **blackbunny**: Moved `kgLimits: "Min Feeding Time: 40.00 (31.00 ðŸŒˆ)"` from being a property to a `const` declaration inside the `calculate` function.

All changes follow the same pattern as the example you provided, making the `kgLimits` information available within the `calculate` functions as constants while removing them as direct properties of the pet objects. The `chicken` pet didn't have a `kgLimits` property, so it was left unchanged.
