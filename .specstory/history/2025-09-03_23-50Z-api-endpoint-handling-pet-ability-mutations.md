# API endpoint handling pet ability mutations (2025-09-03 23:50Z)

_**User (2025-09-04 01:14Z)**_

Does the /api/pets/:petkey/ability endpoint account for the changes to the ability due to mutations?

---

_**Assistant**_

I need to search for the API endpoint and understand how it handles pet abilities and mutations. Let me start by looking for the API endpoint definition and then examine how mutations affect pet abilities. Now let me examine the `server.js` file to see the actual implementation of this endpoint: Let me get more context around this endpoint implementation: I need to see the complete implementation of this endpoint. Let me search for more of the function: Now let me look at the actual `server.js` implementation to see the complete endpoint: Let me get a larger section around this endpoint to see the complete implementation: Now I have a clear understanding of how the API endpoint works. Let me also check what mutations are available: Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can now answer your question about whether the `/api/pets/:petkey/ability` endpoint accounts for changes to pet abilities due to mutations.

**Yes, the `/api/pets/:petkey/ability` endpoint does account for mutations.** 

Here's how it works:

## The API Endpoint Implementation

The endpoint in `server.js` accepts a `modifierType` query parameter:

```javascript
app.get('/api/pets/:petKey/ability', async (req, res) => {
    const { weight, modifierType = 'none' } = req.query;
    // ... validation ...
    const abilityText = pet.calculate(validatedWeight, validatedModifier);
    // ... returns result with modifierType included ...
}
```

## What Mutations Are Supported

The system supports both **enhancement mutations** and **additional ability mutations**:

**Enhancement Mutations (affect base pet abilities):**
- `golden` - 10% boost to passive base values
- `rainbow` - 20% boost to passive base values

**Additional Ability Mutations (add new abilities):**
- `shocked` - Applies lightning during thunderstorms
- `frozen` - Applies freeze effects to nearby fruits  
- `windy` - Applies windstruck effects
- `ironskin` - Chance to get stolen fruit back
- `radiant` - Advances plant growth by 24 hours
- `ascended` - Applies dawnbound mutation
- `tranquil` - Applies tranquil mutation
- `corrupted` - Applies corrupted mutation
- `glimmering` - Applies glimmering mutation

## How Mutations Affect Calculations

Looking at your current file `mythicalEgg.js`, all pets already implement the mutation system:

```javascript
calculate: (kg, modifierType = "none") => {
    const { value: modifier, text: modifierText, style: modifierStyle } = getModifierDetails(modifierType);
    
    // Base calculations with mutation modifiers applied
    const baseChance = 5 + (kg / 10);
    const baseChanceMod = 5 * modifier;  // Golden/Rainbow boost
    const baseChanceTotal = baseChance + baseChanceMod;
    
    // Display text includes mutation styling
    const displayText = modifier > 0 ? ` <span style='${modifierStyle}'>${modifierText}</span>` : "";
}
```

## API Usage Examples

```bash
# Normal pet ability
GET /api/pets/brownmouse/ability?weight=50

# With Golden mutation (10% boost)
GET /api/pets/brownmouse/ability?weight=50&modifierType=golden

# With Shocked mutation (additional lightning ability)
GET /api/pets/brownmouse/ability?weight=50&modifierType=shocked
```

So yes, the API endpoint fully supports and accounts for all mutation effects on pet abilities, both for base ability enhancements and additional mutation-specific abilities.

The API response does not match the web site.

---

_**Assistant**_

I can see the issue! Looking at the screenshot, the website shows:

1. **Pet Mutation**: "Rainbow (20% boost to passive base)" is selected
2. **URL**: Shows `modifierType=rainbow` 
3. **API Response**: Shows `"modifierType":"none"` in the JSON response

The problem is that the API endpoint is not properly handling the `modifierType` parameter. Let me examine the server code to see what's happening. Let me check the rest of this endpoint to see how it returns the response: The server code looks correct. Let me check how the validation function handles the `modifierType` parameter: Now let me check the `validateModifierType` function: The validation looks correct too. Let me test the actual API call to see what's happening. First, let me check if the server is running and make a test call: The server isn't running. Let me start it and test: The server has a missing dependency. Let me install the dependencies and then test: Now let me start the server again: Good! Now let me test the API endpoint: It looks like the server is running on port 8029, not 3000. Let me test with the correct port: Let me check if the server is actually running: It seems like the server started and then stopped. Let me start it again and check what happens: Great! Now let me test the API: Let me try again. The server is running so let me test in a new terminal: Let me try a simpler curl command: Let me check if there's an issue with the server. First, let me check what's in the paradiseEgg.js file to see if the mimicoctopus pet exists:

I think I see the issue. modifierType appears to be case sensitive and it wants a capital T in Type?

---

_**Assistant**_

You're absolutely right! Let me check the server code to see if there's a case sensitivity issue with the parameter name. Let me examine how the request parameters are being extracted: The server code looks correct - it's extracting `modifierType` from the query parameters. But let me check if there's something in the frontend or URL that's causing the issue. Let me look at the URL from your screenshot more carefully.

Looking at your screenshot, the URL shows `modifierType=rainbow`, but the API response shows `"modifierType":"none"`. This suggests the parameter isn't being received properly.

Let me check if there might be another parameter name being used. Let me search for any references to different cases: Let me also check the frontend JavaScript to see how the API is being called: Let me check the HTML file to see how the frontend makes the API calls:

_**User (2025-09-04 01:20Z)**_

Can the parameters for the api be case-insensitive?

---

_**Assistant**_

Good question! Let me check how the parameters are currently handled and see if we can make them case-insensitive. Currently, URL query parameters in Express.js are case-sensitive by default.

Let me examine the current parameter extraction in the server: Yes, we can definitely make the parameters case-insensitive! This would be a great improvement for API usability. Here's how we can modify the endpoint to handle case-insensitive parameters: 
```

```
Now let me also check if there are other API endpoints that could benefit from this case-insensitive parameter handling. Let me search for other
