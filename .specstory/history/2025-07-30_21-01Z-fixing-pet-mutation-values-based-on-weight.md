# Fixing pet mutation values based on weight (2025-07-30 21:01Z)

The pet mutation values don't seem to be updating bsaed on weight, but rather they are coming across as a fixed value.

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you investigate the issue with pet mutation values not updating based on weight. Let me first examine the current code to understand how the mutation values are calculated. I need to continue reading the rest of the file to see how pet mutations are handled: Now I need to see the `temp_pet_data.js` file to understand how pet weights are being handled: Now I can see the issue! Looking at the code, I found the problem with pet mutation values not updating based on weight. The issue is in the main `petAbilities.js` file where modifier calculations are missing for many of the pet mutation options.

Let me examine the specific issue. In the current `petAbilities.js`, I can see that for pet mutations like "Shocked Pet Mutation", "Frozen Pet Mutation", etc., the modifier calculations are present but there might be an issue with how the modifiers are being applied.

Looking at the main `getPetMutationDescription` function around line 35, I see:

```javascript
// Use the calculate function with sample weight (50kg) to get the mutation description
if (typeof petMutationOptions[mutationKey].calculate === 'function') {
    return petMutationOptions[mutationKey].calculate(50, 'none');
}
```

The issue is that this function is using a fixed sample weight of **50kg** instead of the actual pet's weight! This means pet mutations will always show the same values regardless of the pet's actual weight.

Let me also check how this function is being used in the broader context to fix it properly: Let me check how the `getPetMutationDescription` function is being called to understand the context better: I see! The issue is in the `getPetMutationDescription` function in `petAbilities.js`. It's hardcoded to use a sample weight of 50kg instead of receiving the actual weight as a parameter.

The problem is at line 42-44 of `petAbilities.js`:

```javascript
// Use the calculate function with sample weight (50kg) to get the mutation description
if (typeof petMutationOptions[mutationKey].calculate === 'function') {
    return petMutationOptions[mutationKey].calculate(50, 'none');
}
```

The function should accept a weight parameter and use that instead of the hardcoded 50kg. Let me fix this: 
```

```
Now I need to update the calls to `getPetMutationDescription` in the `pets.html` file to pass the actual weight. Let me first check where the weight value is available in those sections: Perfect! I can see that the `weight` variable is available at line 1669. Now let me update this call to pass the weight: 
```

```
Now let me find and update the other calls to `getPetMutationDescription`: I can see the comparison section has two calls that need to be updated. The weights are `weight1` and `weight2`. Let me update these: 
```

```

```

```
Now I need to update the method definition in the Calculator object to accept the weight parameter: Let me check the exact format around that function: 
```

```
Great! Now let me test the fix by opening the `pets.html` file in a browser to see if the pet mutation values are updating based on weight: Perfect! I have fixed the issue. Let me also run a test to make sure our fix worked by checking a terminal command: ## Summary

I found and fixed the issue with pet mutation values not updating based on weight. The problem was in the `getPetMutationDescription` function in `petAbilities.js`, which was hardcoded to use a sample weight of 50kg instead of the actual pet's weight.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated `getPetMutationDescription` function in `petAbilities.js`:**
   - Added a `kg` parameter with a default value of 50
   - Changed the function to use the actual weight instead of the hardcoded 50kg value

2. **Updated all calls to `getPetMutationDescription` in `pets.html`:**
   - Modified the single pet calculation to pass the `weight` parameter
   - Modified the comparison calculations to pass `weight1` and `weight2` parameters
   - Updated the method signature in the Calculator object

3. **Updated the method definition:**
   - Added weight parameter to the method documentation
   - Made the function accept and forward the weight parameter properly

### The Fix:
Previously, all pet mutations would show the same values because they were calculated using a fixed 50kg weight. Now, the mutation values will properly scale based on the actual weight of the pet, showing different cooldown times, chances, and other values as the pet's weight changes.

You can now test this by:
1. Selecting any pet with mutation abilities (like Shocked, Frozen, Windy, etc.)
2. Changing the weight value
3. Observing that the mutation descriptions now update to reflect the actual pet weight rather than staying fixed

The pet mutation values will now properly update based on the pet's weight, providing accurate and dynamic calculations for all pet mutation abilities.
