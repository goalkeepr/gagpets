I'll add the pets from your specifications to the chestsEventsOther.js file. Let me analyze the format and structure first, then add each pet with the proper calculations. Now I'll add the new pets to the file. Based on the format, I need to convert the Lua-style data to JavaScript format and create proper calculate functions for each pet:

````javascript
