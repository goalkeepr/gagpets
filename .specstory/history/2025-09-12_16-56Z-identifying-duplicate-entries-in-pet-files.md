Identify any duplicate entries among all files in the pets folder.

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

I'll help you identify duplicate entries across all the pet files. Let me analyze the pet data systematically by reading through each file and comparing the pet entries. Let me read all the pet files to analyze their contents for duplicates. I'll start by reading multiple files in parallel to gather the data efficiently. Let me continue reading the remaining files to complete the analysis: Let me continue reading the remaining files: Let me continue reading the remaining files: Let me finish reading the last few files: Now I'll analyze all the pet data I've collected to identify duplicates. Let me extract the pet information and compare across files: Based on my analysis of all 23 pet files, I've identified several duplicate entries. Let me compile the comprehensive duplicate report: ## Duplicate Pet Entries Analysis Report

After analyzing all 23 pet files in the `` folder, I found several duplicate entries across different files. Here are the duplicates identified:

### üîç **Confirmed Duplicates Found:**

#### 1. **Kiwi** ü•ù
- **Location 1:** `birds_new.js` (line in birdPets object)
- **Location 2:** `chestsEventsOther.js` (in CHESTS_EVENTS_OTHER_PETS)
- **Details:** Both have identical functionality (reduces egg hatch times), same icon URL, same type ("bird"), same rarity ("Rare"). The calculation formulas are identical.

#### 2. **Owl** ü¶â
- **Location 1:** `birds_new.js` (in birdPets object)  
- **Location 2:** `chestsEventsOther.js` (in CHESTS_EVENTS_OTHER_PETS)
- **Details:** Both are XP bonus providers with identical calculation formulas, same icon URL, same type ("bird"), same rarity ("Mythical").

#### 3. **Tanchozuru** üïäÔ∏è
- **Location 1:** `birds_new.js` (in birdPets object)
- **Location 2:** `chestsEventsOther.js` (in CHESTS_EVENTS_OTHER_PETS)
- **Location 3:** `zenEgg.js` (in ZEN_EGG_PETS, named "Tancho-zuru")
- **Details:** All three have identical meditation/tranquil mutation functionality, same icon URL, same type ("bird"), same rarity ("Legendary"). Small name variation in `zenEgg.js` but same pet.

### üé® **Rainbow Exotic Variations (Expected Duplicates):**

The `rainbowExotic.js` file contains enhanced versions of pets from other categories, which are intentionally designed as upgraded variants:

- **Rainbow Parasaurolophus** (enhanced version of Parasaurolophus from primalEgg.js)
- **Rainbow Iguanodon** (enhanced version of Iguanodon from primalEgg.js)  
- **Rainbow Pachycephalosaurus** (enhanced version of Pachycephalosaurus from primalEgg.js)
- **Rainbow Dilophosaurus** (enhanced version of Dilophosaurus from primalEgg.js)
- **Rainbow Ankylosaurus** (enhanced version of Ankylosaurus from primalEgg.js)
- **Rainbow Spinosaurus** (enhanced version of Spinosaurus from primalEgg.js)
- **Rainbow Maneki-neko** (enhanced version of Maneki-neko from chestsEventsOther.js)
- **Rainbow Kodama** (enhanced version of Kodama from chestsEventsOther.js)
- **Rainbow Corrupted Kitsune** (enhanced version of Corrupted Kitsune from chestsEventsOther.js)
- **Rainbow Bacon Pig** (enhanced version of Bacon Pig from chestsEventsOther.js)
- **Rainbow Hotdog Daschund** (enhanced version of Hotdog Daschund from chestsEventsOther.js)
- **Rainbow Lobster Thermidor** (enhanced version of Lobster Thermidor from chestsEventsOther.js)
- **Rainbow Elk** (enhanced version of Elk from chestsEventsOther.js)
- **Rainbow Mandrake** (enhanced version of Mandrake from chestsEventsOther.js)
- **Rainbow Griffin** (enhanced version of Griffin from chestsEventsOther.js)
- **Rainbow Cardinal** (enhanced version of Cardinal from enchantedEgg.js)
- **Rainbow Shroomie** (enhanced version of Shroomie from enchantedEgg.js)
- **Rainbow Phoenix** (enhanced version of Phoenix from enchantedEgg.js)

### üìä **Summary:**

- **3 True Duplicates Found:** Kiwi, Owl, and Tanchozuru appear in multiple files with identical or nearly identical functionality
- **19 Rainbow Variants:** These are intentional enhanced versions, not accidental duplicates
- **Total Files Analyzed:** 23
- **Total Unique Pet Entries:** 142+ pets analyzed

### üí° **Recommendations:**

1. **Remove duplicate entries** for Kiwi, Owl, and Tanchozuru from either `birds_new.js` or `chestsEventsOther.js` to avoid conflicts
2. **Standardize the naming** for Tanchozuru vs "Tancho-zuru" 
3. **Consider consolidating** the bird pets from `birds_new.js` into more appropriate category files
4. **Keep Rainbow variants** as they appear to be intentional enhanced versions

The duplicate entries could cause issues in the pet system if both versions are loaded simultaneously, potentially leading to conflicts in the global pet registry.
