# Fixing GitHub account issues for pushing changes (2025-10-07 15:31Z)

_**User (2025-10-07 15:31Z)**_

I am not able to push my changes to github because it is using the wrong github account. How do I fix that?

To fix Git pushing to the wrong GitHub account, you need to update your Git credentials. Here’s how you can resolve this on macOS:

1. Check which account is currently set:
   ```zsh
   git config --get user.name
   git config --get user.email
   ```

2. Update your Git config to use the correct account:
   ```zsh
   git config --global user.name "Your Correct Username"
   git config --global user.email "your-correct-email@example.com"
   ```

3. If you use HTTPS and macOS Keychain, clear the old credentials:
   - Open "Keychain Access" and search for "github.com".
   - Delete any old GitHub credentials.

4. Next time you push, Git will prompt for your username and personal access token. Enter the correct account details.

5. If you use SSH, make sure your SSH key is added to the correct GitHub account:
   - Check your SSH key: `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
   - Add it to your GitHub account under "Settings > SSH and GPG keys".

6. You can also set the remote URL to use the correct account:
   ```zsh
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/goalkeepr/gagpets.git
   ```

After these steps, try pushing again. If you still have issues, let me know your authentication method (HTTPS or SSH) and I can provide more specific help.

Looks OK but it's not letting me?

The error message means your GitHub account does not have write (push) permissions to the `goalkeepr/gagpets` repository. This is not a local Git config issue—it's a GitHub permissions issue.

Here’s how to resolve it:

1. **Are you the owner or a collaborator?**
   - If you are not a collaborator on `goalkeepr/gagpets`, you cannot push directly.
   - You can only push if you are added as a collaborator by the repo owner.

2. **If you are the owner or collaborator:**
   - Make sure you are signed into GitHub with the correct account in your browser and in VS Code.
   - If using HTTPS, ensure your credentials/token are for the correct account.

3. **If you are NOT a collaborator:**
   - You must fork the repository and push to your fork.
   - Then, create a pull request to merge your changes into the original repo.

**Summary:**  
You need write access to push directly. If you don’t have it, fork the repo and push to your fork, then open a pull request.

Let me know if you want instructions for forking and pushing, or if you need help with GitHub authentication setup.
