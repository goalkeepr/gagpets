_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add these new pets to the `chestsEventsOther.js` file. First, let me examine the current structure of the file to understand the existing format and add the pets correctly. I can see the current structure of the file. Now I need to convert the provided pet data from what appears to be a Roblox/Lua format to the JavaScript format used in this file. Let me add the new pets by converting them to match the existing structure.
