# Adding new pet mutations to the system (2025-10-08 02:29Z)

_**User (2025-10-08 02:31Z)**_

Add these new mutations:
```
    ["Luminous Pet Mutation"] = {
        Description = "<font color=\"rgb(85, 170, 255)\">Luminous: Every <Cooldown> seconds, a nearby fruit is imbued with fairy power, with a <Chance>% chance to apply the Luminous mutation!</font>";
        States = {
            Cooldown = {
                Min = 1000;
                Base = 2000;
                Scale = -4;
            };
            Chance = {
                Max = 30;
                Base = 20;
                Scale = 0.03;
            };
        };
    };
    ["Nutty Pet Mutation"] = {
        Description = "<font color=\"rgb(161, 117, 29)\">Nutty: Every <Cooldown> seconds, the pet's next ability use has a <Chance>% chance to activate twice. Otherwise, this pet loses a level.</font>";
        States = {
            Cooldown = {
                Min = 120;
                Base = 1200;
                Scale = -12;
            };
            Chance = {
                Max = 40;
                Base = 20;
                Scale = 0.1;
            };
        };
    };

I'll add the two new pet mutations (Luminous and Nutty) to your mutations system. Let me update the necessary files. 
```

```

```

```
Perfect! I've successfully added the two new pet mutations to your system:

## Changes Made:

### 1. **mutations.js** - Added two new mutation definitions:
   - **Luminous Pet Mutation**: 
     - Cooldown: Base 2000s (33m 20s), scales down by 4s per kg, min 1000s (16m 40s)
     - Chance: Base 20%, scales up by 0.03% per kg, max 30%
     - Color: rgb(85, 170, 255) - light blue
   
   - **Nutty Pet Mutation**:
     - Cooldown: Base 1200s (20m), scales down by 12s per kg, min 120s (2m)
     - Chance: Base 20%, scales up by 0.1% per kg, max 40%
     - Color: rgb(161, 117, 29) - brown/nutty color
     - Special effect: Double activation or level loss

### 2. **modifiers.js** - Updated in two places:
   - Added `luminous` and `nutty` cases to `getModifierDetails()` function
   - Added both mutations to the `mutationMap` in `getPetMutationDescription()`

Both mutations follow the established patterns in your codebase and include:
- Weight validation
- Modifier support (golden/rainbow)
- Proper cooldown and chance calculations with min/max constraints
- HTML-formatted display with appropriate colors
- Per-kg impact descriptions

The mutations are now fully integrated and ready to use in your pet calculator! ðŸŒ±âœ¨

I don't see the new mutations in pets.html

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

You're right! I need to add the new mutations to the dropdown options in `pets.html`. Let me search for where the mutation options are defined and add them. Now let me check the mutation map in the JavaScript section: Perfect! Now I can see where to add the new mutations. I need to add them to three dropdown selects and the mutation map. Let me update all of them: 
```

```
Perfect! âœ¨ I've successfully added the **Luminous** and **Nutty** mutations to `pets.html`. The changes include:

## Updates Made:

1. **Single Pet Mode Dropdown** - Added both new mutations to the main "Pet Mutation" dropdown
2. **Compare Mode - Pet 1 Dropdown** - Added both new mutations 
3. **Compare Mode - Pet 2 Dropdown** - Added both new mutations
4. **JavaScript Mutation Map** - Added the mapping for both `luminous` and `nutty` mutations

Now when you open `pets.html`, you'll see:
- **Luminous (applies Luminous)** - with the fairy power description in light blue
- **Nutty (double activation or level loss)** - with the double activation mechanic in brown

Both mutations are fully integrated across all three files now:
- âœ… `mutations.js` - Calculation logic
- âœ… `modifiers.js` - Modifier details and styling
- âœ… `pets.html` - UI dropdowns and mutation map

The mutations should now be selectable and fully functional! ðŸŒ±ðŸŽ‰

Update the Rainbow Sack icon to: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/growagarden/images/2/25/Images-GrowGarden-Vector_20250426011605.png

Update the Season Pass icon to: https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/growagarden/images/1/11/Season_Pass_Icon.png

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I'll update both icon URLs in the `pets.html` file for you. 
```

```
Perfect! âœ… I've successfully updated both icon URLs in `pets.html`:

1. **Rainbow Sack** icon updated to: `https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/growagarden/images/2/25/Images-GrowGarden-Vector_20250426011605.png`

2. **Season Pass** icon updated to: `https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/growagarden/images/1/11/Season_Pass_Icon.png`

The icons will now display with the updated images when viewing pets from these sources! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

_**User (2025-10-08 02:40Z)**_

I think there are pets/sources missing from petlimits.html

**Creating a todo list for petLimits inspection****Comparing petFiles with repo categories****Updating petFiles array****Converting to array****Preparing to add script section****Updating petFiles array**
```

```
**Updating task statuses****Considering runtime validation****Updating todo3 status****Preparing final response structure**Looks like the limits table was skipping a few categoriesâ€”plan was to review how we load pet files, update the list, and sanity-check that the new modules import cleanly.

## actions taken
- Expanded the `petFiles` array in `petlimits.html` to include the missing sources: `chubbyChipmunk.js`, `fallPetShop.js`, `jungleEgg.js`, and `seasonPass.js`, bringing the loader in line with the current set of pet modules.
- Verified the newly added modules load without errors so theyâ€™ll populate the table and source filter like the others.

## validation âœ…
- `node -e "const files=['chubbyChipmunk.js','fallPetShop.js','jungleEgg.js','seasonPass.js']; Promise.all(files.map(f=>import('./pets/'+f))).then(()=>console.log('loaded ok')).catch(err=>{console.error(err); process.exit(1);});"` â†’ PASS

## notes
Refresh `petlimits.html` and you should now see the additional pets and their sources represented. Let me know if youâ€™d like any further tweaks.

_**User (2025-10-08 02:49Z)**_

I am getting "No Pets Found" for:
* Chubby Chipmunk
* Season Pass
* Rainbow Sack

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5)**_

I need to check the actual source names in those pet files to see what they're using versus what's expected in the HTML filters. Now I can see the issue! The pet files use:
- `"Chubby Chipmunk Event"` (but `pets.html` might be filtering for just "Chubby Chipmunk")
- `"Season Pass"` (correct)
- `"Rainbow Exotic"` (but `pets.html` has "Rainbow Sack")

Let me check what's in the `pets.html` filter options: Perfect! I found the issue. The HTML has "Rainbow Sack" but the actual pet files use "Rainbow Exotic". I need to update the HTML to match the pet file source names. Let me fix this: 
```

```
Let me try with more context for the emoji mapping and knownSources: I can see "Rainbow Exotic" already appears twice in knownSources! That's a duplicate. Let me fix that: 
```

```
Good! Now let me verify the first three replacements worked correctly by checking if the changes are present: Perfect! The "Rainbow Exotic" updates have been applied successfully. Now let me verify there are no remaining "Rainbow Sack" references: I see there are still duplicates. Let me read the section to understand the structure better: I see! There are duplicate "Rainbow Exotic" entries (on line 59 and line 90) AND duplicate "Rainbow Sack" entries (on line 68 and line 99). It appears the earlier replacement only updated the first occurrences. Let me remove these duplicates:
