I'll help you add these new pets to your `pets.html` file. First, let me read the current file to understand its structure and then add the new pets. Now I'll add the new pets to the `petAbilities` object in the JavaScript. I can see the structure and will insert the new pets in the appropriate location: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully added all 6 new pets to your `pets.html` file:

1. **Pterodactyl** 🦕 - Flaps wings to send ripples causing Windstruck with chance for Twisted, plus jump height bonus
2. **Queen Bee** 👑 - Pollinates fruits and refreshes pet abilities with the highest cooldown

5. **Sand Snake** 🐍 - Duplicates purchased items from seed/gear shop

Each pet has been implemented with:
- Proper scaling formulas based on the kg parameter
- Per-kilogram impact descriptions

The pets will now appear in the dropdown menu alphabetically sorted with all the other pets, and users can calculate their abilities at different weights or compare two different weights for each pet.
