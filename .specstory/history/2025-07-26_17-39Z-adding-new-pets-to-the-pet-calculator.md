I'll help you add these new pets to your pet calculator! Let me examine the structure of the existing pet data and add the new ones. Let me look at where the pet abilities are defined: Let me continue reading to find the end of the petAbilities object to see where to add the new pets: Let me find the end of the petAbilities object: Let me check around line 2580 which is likely the end of the petAbilities object: Perfect! I found the end of the petAbilities object. Now I'll add the new pets just before the closing `};` on line 2580. Let me add all the new pets with their proper structure: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully added all 8 new pets to your pet calculator. Here's what I added:

## New Pets Added:

1. **Football** (Legendary) - Runs to shops and scores touchdowns for sheckles or watering cans
2. **Maneki-neko** (Uncommon) - Fortune cat that grants fruit refund chances
3. **Tsuchinoko** (Rare) - Fat snake that increases seed drop chances
4. **Kodama** (Legendary) - Tree spirit that applies Tranquil mutations to Zen fruits
5. **Corrupted Kodama** (Legendary) - Corrupted tree spirit that applies Corrupt mutations to Zen fruits
6. **Raiju** (Mythical) - Lightning beast that devours shocked fruits and creates chain lightning
7. **Mizuchi** (Divine) - Water deity that spreads mutations from wet/drenched fruits
8. **Corrupted Kitsune** (Prismatic) - Nine-tailed fox that applies Corrupt Chakra mutations

Each pet has been properly integrated with:
- ✅ Name, icon, type, and rarity information
- ✅ Description matching the original data
- ✅ Calculation function that processes the formulas based on weight (kg)
- ✅ Per-kg impact descriptions for the tooltip system
- ✅ Proper HTML formatting with bold text and time/number formatting
- ✅ Input validation using the existing utility functions

The pets will now be available in your dropdown menu and grid view, with filtering by type and rarity working correctly. Users can calculate their abilities at different weights and compare them using the existing comparison feature.
