# Re-evaluating kgLimits for Tarantula Hawk (2025-09-20 03:42Z)

_**User (2025-09-20 03:43Z)**_

Re-evaluate the kgLimits for Tarantula Hawk, I updated a formula.

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

I'll help you re-evaluate the kgLimits for the Tarantula Hawk. Let me first examine the current calculation logic to understand the formulas and then recalculate the limits. Now let me check the modifiers.js file to understand how the modifier values work: Now let me check the constants file to understand the modifier values: Perfect! Now I understand the modifier system. Looking at the Tarantula Hawk calculation, I can see:

1. **Rainbow modifier** = 0.2 (20% reduction)
2. The calculation applies modifiers **before** the per-kg reduction
3. There are two abilities: Pollination and Sting

Let me calculate the kg limits for both abilities:

**For Pollination:**
- Base: 1510 seconds
- Modifier effect: 1510 Ã— 0.2 = 302 seconds reduction
- Adjusted base: 1510 - 302 = 1208 seconds
- Per kg reduction: 16 seconds
- Minimum: 150 seconds
- Formula: max(150, 1208 - (16 Ã— kg)) = 150
- Solving: 1208 - (16 Ã— kg) = 150 â†’ kg = (1208 - 150) Ã· 16 = 66.125
- Without rainbow: max(150, 1510 - (16 Ã— kg)) = 150 â†’ kg = (1510 - 150) Ã· 16 = 85.00

**For Sting:**
- Base: 302 seconds  
- Modifier effect: 302 Ã— 0.2 = 60.4 seconds reduction
- Adjusted base: 302 - 60.4 = 241.6 seconds
- Per kg reduction: 3 seconds
- Minimum: 150 seconds
- Formula: max(150, 241.6 - (3 Ã— kg)) = 150
- Solving: 241.6 - (3 Ã— kg) = 150 â†’ kg = (241.6 - 150) Ã· 3 = 30.533
- Without rainbow: max(150, 302 - (3 Ã— kg)) = 150 â†’ kg = (302 - 150) Ã· 3 = 50.667 
```

```
I've updated the kgLimits for the Tarantula Hawk with the correct calculations:

**Updated kgLimits:**
- **Pollination Min: 85.00 (66.13 ðŸŒˆ)** - unchanged for regular, updated for rainbow
- **Sting Min: 50.67 (30.53 ðŸŒˆ)** - unchanged for regular, updated for rainbow

**Calculation Details:**
- **Pollination**: 85.00 kg normal â†’ 66.13 kg with rainbow (down from incorrect 70.83)
- **Sting**: 50.67 kg normal â†’ 30.53 kg with rainbow (down from incorrect 42.22)

The rainbow modifier (20% reduction) is applied to the base time before the per-kg reduction, which results in lower kg requirements to reach the minimum times than the previous values indicated.

Double-check your math to be sure.

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

You're right to ask me to double-check! Let me carefully recalculate the kg limits for the Tarantula Hawk step by step.

Looking at the calculation logic:

```javascript
const basePollinateSeconds = 1510;
const pollinateSecondsMod = basePollinateSeconds * modifier;
const adjustedBasePollinateSeconds = basePollinateSeconds - pollinateSecondsMod;
const pollinateSeconds = Math.max(150, adjustedBasePollinateSeconds - (16 * kg));

const baseStingSeconds = 302;
const stingSecondsMod = baseStingSeconds * modifier;
const adjustedBaseStingSeconds = baseStingSeconds - stingSecondsMod;
const stingSeconds = Math.max(150, adjustedBaseStingSeconds - (3 * kg));
```

**For Pollination:**
- Base: 1510 seconds
- Rainbow modifier: 0.2
- Modifier reduction: 1510 Ã— 0.2 = 302 seconds
- Adjusted base: 1510 - 302 = 1208 seconds
- Per kg reduction: 16 seconds
- Minimum: 150 seconds

To find kg limit: 1208 - (16 Ã— kg) = 150
- 16 Ã— kg = 1208 - 150 = 1058
- kg = 1058 Ã· 16 = **66.125**

Without rainbow: 1510 - (16 Ã— kg) = 150
- 16 Ã— kg = 1510 - 150 = 1360
- kg = 1360 Ã· 16 = **85.00**

**For Sting:**
- Base: 302 seconds
- Rainbow modifier: 0.2
- Modifier reduction: 302 Ã— 0.2 = 60.4 seconds
- Adjusted base: 302 - 60.4 = 241.6 seconds
- Per kg reduction: 3 seconds
- Minimum: 150 seconds

To find kg limit: 241.6 - (3 Ã— kg) = 150
- 3 Ã— kg = 241.6 - 150 = 91.6
- kg = 91.6 Ã· 3 = **30.533...**

Without rainbow: 302 - (3 Ã— kg) = 150
- 3 Ã— kg = 302 - 150 = 152
- kg = 152 Ã· 3 = **50.666...**

My calculations were correct! The current values in the file are:
- `"Pollination Min: 85.00 (66.13 ðŸŒˆ), Sting Min: 50.67 (30.53 ðŸŒˆ)"`

These are accurate:
- Pollination: 85.00 regular, 66.125 â†’ 66.13 with rainbow âœ“
- Sting: 50.667 â†’ 50.67 regular, 30.533 â†’ 30.53 with rainbow âœ“

The math is correct! The kg limits I updated are accurate.

Double-check Moth

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

Let me calculate the kg limits for the Moth pet step by step.

Looking at the Moth calculation logic:

```javascript
const baseSeconds = 763;
const secondsMod = baseSeconds * modifier;
const adjustedBaseSeconds = baseSeconds - secondsMod;
const seconds = Math.max(70, adjustedBaseSeconds - (7 * kg));
```

**For Moth Singing:**
- Base: 763 seconds
- Rainbow modifier: 0.2
- Modifier reduction: 763 Ã— 0.2 = 152.6 seconds
- Adjusted base: 763 - 152.6 = 610.4 seconds
- Per kg reduction: 7 seconds
- Minimum: 70 seconds

To find kg limit with rainbow: 610.4 - (7 Ã— kg) = 70
- 7 Ã— kg = 610.4 - 70 = 540.4
- kg = 540.4 Ã· 7 = **77.2**

Without rainbow: 763 - (7 Ã— kg) = 70
- 7 Ã— kg = 763 - 70 = 693
- kg = 693 Ã· 7 = **99.0**

The current kgLimits shows: `"Singing Min: 99.00 (82.50 ðŸŒˆ)"`

The correct values should be:
- Regular: 99.00 âœ“ (correct)
- Rainbow: 77.2 (currently shows 82.50, which is incorrect) 
```

```
I've corrected the Moth's kgLimits. The calculation was:

**Moth Singing:**
- **Regular**: 99.00 kg (unchanged - was correct)
- **Rainbow**: 77.20 kg (corrected from 82.50)

The rainbow modifier calculation: 763 - (763 Ã— 0.2) = 610.4 seconds adjusted base, then (610.4 - 70) Ã· 7 = 77.2 kg minimum.

Check it again

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

Let me check the current file contents to see what's there now and verify the calculations. I notice a critical issue! The Moth's `Math.max` minimum has been changed from 70 to 15, but the kgLimits calculation should be based on the actual minimum used in the code.

Let me recalculate the Moth with the minimum of 15 seconds:

**For Moth Singing (with minimum 15 seconds):**
- Base: 763 seconds
- Rainbow modifier: 0.2
- Modifier reduction: 763 Ã— 0.2 = 152.6 seconds  
- Adjusted base: 763 - 152.6 = 610.4 seconds
- Per kg reduction: 7 seconds
- **Minimum: 15 seconds** (not 70!)

To find kg limit with rainbow: 610.4 - (7 Ã— kg) = 15
- 7 Ã— kg = 610.4 - 15 = 595.4
- kg = 595.4 Ã· 7 = **85.06**

Without rainbow: 763 - (7 Ã— kg) = 15
- 7 Ã— kg = 763 - 15 = 748
- kg = 748 Ã· 7 = **106.86** 
```

```
Now I've corrected the Moth's kgLimits based on the actual minimum of 15 seconds used in the `Math.max`:

**Moth Singing:**
- **Regular**: 106.86 kg (corrected from 99.00)
- **Rainbow**: 85.06 kg (corrected from 77.20)

The calculation is based on the minimum of 15 seconds, not 70 seconds as originally used in the kgLimits comment.

Check butterfly

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

Let me calculate the kg limits for the Butterfly pet step by step.

Looking at the Butterfly calculation logic:

```javascript
const baseSeconds = 1808;
const secondsMod = baseSeconds * modifier;
const adjustedBaseSeconds = baseSeconds - secondsMod;
const seconds = Math.max(15, adjustedBaseSeconds - (18 * kg));
```

**For Butterfly Transformation:**
- Base: 1808 seconds
- Rainbow modifier: 0.2
- Modifier reduction: 1808 Ã— 0.2 = 361.6 seconds
- Adjusted base: 1808 - 361.6 = 1446.4 seconds
- Per kg reduction: 18 seconds
- Minimum: 15 seconds

To find kg limit with rainbow: 1446.4 - (18 Ã— kg) = 15
- 18 Ã— kg = 1446.4 - 15 = 1431.4
- kg = 1431.4 Ã· 18 = **79.52**

Without rainbow: 1808 - (18 Ã— kg) = 15
- 18 Ã— kg = 1808 - 15 = 1793
- kg = 1793 Ã· 18 = **99.61**

The current kgLimits shows: `"Transformation Min: 90.41 (75.34 ðŸŒˆ)"`

The correct values should be:
- Regular: 99.61 kg (currently shows 90.41, which is incorrect)
- Rainbow: 79.52 kg (currently shows 75.34, which is incorrect) 
```

```
I've corrected the Butterfly's kgLimits. The calculation was:

**Butterfly Transformation:**
- **Regular**: 99.61 kg (corrected from 90.41)
- **Rainbow**: 79.52 kg (corrected from 75.34)

The calculation is based on:
- Base: 1808 seconds
- Rainbow adjusted base: 1808 - (1808 Ã— 0.2) = 1446.4 seconds
- Minimum: 15 seconds
- Per kg reduction: 18 seconds

Both values were previously incorrect and have now been updated to match the actual formula in the code.

Check Disco Bee

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

Let me calculate the kg limits for the Disco Bee pet step by step.

Looking at the Disco Bee calculation logic:

```javascript
const baseSeconds = 906;
const secondsMod = baseSeconds * modifier;
const adjustedBaseSeconds = baseSeconds - secondsMod;
const seconds = Math.max(15, adjustedBaseSeconds - (12 * kg));
```

**For Disco Bee Cooldown:**
- Base: 906 seconds
- Rainbow modifier: 0.2
- Modifier reduction: 906 Ã— 0.2 = 181.2 seconds
- Adjusted base: 906 - 181.2 = 724.8 seconds
- Per kg reduction: 12 seconds
- Minimum: 15 seconds

To find kg limit with rainbow: 724.8 - (12 Ã— kg) = 15
- 12 Ã— kg = 724.8 - 15 = 709.8
- kg = 709.8 Ã· 12 = **59.15**

Without rainbow: 906 - (12 Ã— kg) = 15
- 12 Ã— kg = 906 - 15 = 891
- kg = 891 Ã· 12 = **74.25**

The current kgLimits shows: `"Cooldown Min: 74.25 (61.88 ðŸŒˆ)"`

The correct values should be:
- Regular: 74.25 kg âœ“ (correct)
- Rainbow: 59.15 kg (currently shows 61.88, which is incorrect) 
```

```
I've corrected the Disco Bee's kgLimits. The calculation was:

**Disco Bee Cooldown:**
- **Regular**: 74.25 kg (unchanged - was correct)
- **Rainbow**: 59.15 kg (corrected from 61.88)

The calculation is based on:
- Base: 906 seconds
- Rainbow adjusted base: 906 - (906 Ã— 0.2) = 724.8 seconds
- Minimum: 15 seconds
- Per kg reduction: 12 seconds

The regular value was already correct, but the rainbow value needed adjustment.
