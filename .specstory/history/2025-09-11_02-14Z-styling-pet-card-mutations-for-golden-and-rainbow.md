# Styling pet card mutations for golden and rainbow (2025-09-11 02:14Z)

_**User (2025-09-11 02:17Z)**_

If the mutation is golden, can we make the pill be a golden color and the text a color that complements it?
If the mutation is rainbow, can we make the bill be rainbow? A friend recommended this style - style: 'background: linear-gradient(45deg, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet);

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add special styling for the golden and rainbow mutations on the pet card. Looking at the current code, I can see the mutation pill styling and will add these enhancements. 
```

```
Now I need to update the JavaScript code that sets the mutation styling to apply these new classes: 
```

```
Perfect! I've added the special styling for golden and rainbow mutations:

## Changes Made:

### Golden Mutation
- **Background**: Beautiful golden gradient using `#ffd700`, `#ffed4e`, and `#ffc107`
- **Text**: Dark color (`#1a1a1a`) for excellent contrast on the golden background
- **Shadow**: Light text shadow for a premium look
- **Glow**: Golden box shadow that matches the theme
- **Border**: Semi-transparent white border for definition

### Rainbow Mutation
- **Background**: Full rainbow gradient using your friend's recommended style: `linear-gradient(45deg, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet)`
- **Text**: White with strong dark shadow for readability across all rainbow colors
- **Animation**: Added a subtle `rainbowShimmer` effect that makes the colors pulse with brightness and saturation
- **Glow**: White box shadow to make it pop
- **Border**: Semi-transparent white border

### JavaScript Update
- Modified the mutation class assignment to dynamically add the specific mutation type (golden, rainbow, etc.) as a CSS class
- This allows for easy expansion to other mutation types in the future

The styling will now automatically apply when a pet card is generated with `mutation=golden` or `mutation=rainbow` in the URL parameters. The golden mutation will have an elegant, luxurious appearance, while the rainbow mutation will have a vibrant, animated rainbow effect that really stands out!

Let's also use the same styling for the Source and Rarity pills if the value contains the word Rainbow.

_**Assistant**_

I'll add the rainbow styling to the source and rarity pills when they contain the word "Rainbow". Let me update the CSS and JavaScript accordingly. 
```

```
Perfect! I've added the rainbow styling for both source and rarity pills when they contain the word "Rainbow". Here's what I implemented:

## Changes Made:

### CSS Updates:
- **Rainbow Source/Rarity Styling**: Added `.source.rainbow` and `.rarity.rainbow` classes that use the same rainbow gradient and animation as the mutation pill
- **Styling Features**:
  - Same rainbow gradient: `linear-gradient(45deg, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet)`
  - White text with strong shadow for readability
  - Rainbow shimmer animation (reusing the existing keyframes)
  - Matching glow and border effects
  - Uses `!important` to override existing rarity color classes when needed

### JavaScript Updates:
- **Source Element**: Now checks if the source contains "rainbow" (case-insensitive) and applies the `rainbow` class to the source container
- **Rarity Element**: Checks if the rarity contains "rainbow" and applies the `rainbow` class instead of the standard rarity color class
- **Case-Insensitive**: Both checks use `.toLowerCase().includes('rainbow')` to catch variations like "Rainbow", "RAINBOW", "rainbow", etc.

Now when a pet card is displayed:
- If the **source** contains "Rainbow" (like "Rainbow Exotic Egg"), the source pill will have the rainbow gradient effect
- If the **rarity** contains "Rainbow" (like "Rainbow Legendary"), the rarity pill will have the rainbow gradient effect  
- If the **mutation** is "rainbow", the mutation pill will have the rainbow gradient effect

All three elements will share the same beautiful rainbow styling with the shimmer animation, creating a cohesive and visually striking appearance for any Rainbow-related content!
