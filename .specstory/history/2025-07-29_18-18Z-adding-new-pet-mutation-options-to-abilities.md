# Adding new pet mutation options to abilities (2025-07-29 18:18Z)

_**User**_

Can you add these additional mutations to the mutation options? These add abilities that are in addition to the ones inherent to the pets themselves.

```
	["Shocked Pet Mutation"] = {
		Description = "<font color=\"rgb(255, 255, 100)\">SHOCKED: During a Thunderstorm: Every <Cooldown>s, has a <Chance>% chance to attract lightning, shocking nearby fruits!</font>";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 45;
				Base = 60;
				Scale = -0.6;
			};
			Chance = {
				Max = 30;
				Base = 25;
				Scale = 0.02;
			};
		};
	};
	["Frozen Pet Mutation"] = {
		Description = "<font color=\"rgb(108, 184, 255)\">FROZEN: Every <Cooldown>m, <Chance>% chance a nearby fruit becomes Frozen!</font>";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 30;
				Base = 300;
				Scale = -3;
				Formatter = "ColonTime";
			};
			Chance = {
				Max = 30;
				Base = 20;
				Scale = 0.03;
			};
		};
	};
	["Windy Pet Mutation"] = {
		Description = "<font color=\"rgb(162, 185, 209)\">WINDY: Every <Cooldown>m, <Chance>% chance a nearby fruit becomes Windstruck!</font>";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 30;
				Base = 300;
				Scale = -3;
				Formatter = "ColonTime";
			};
			Chance = {
				Max = 30;
				Base = 20;
				Scale = 0.03;
			};
		};
	};
	["IronSkin Pet Mutation"] = {
		Description = "<font color=\"rgb(206, 206, 206)\">IRONSKIN: When another player steals fruit from you, grants a <Chance>% chance you get the stolen fruit as well!</font>";
		States = {
			Chance = {
				Max = 45;
				Base = 35;
				Scale = 0.2;
			};
		};
	};
	["Radiant Pet Mutation"] = {
		Description = "<font color=\"rgb(248, 108, 38)\">RADIANT: Every <Cooldown>m, emits sunshine at a random nearby plant and advances their growth by 24 hours!</font>";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 1200;
				Base = 1800;
				Scale = -9;
				Formatter = "ColonTime";
			};
		};
	};
	["Ascended Pet Mutation"] = {
		Description = "<font color=\"rgb(247, 245, 184)\">ASCENDED: Every <Cooldown>m, a nearby fruit ascends to a higher realm, applying the Dawnbound mutation!</font>";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 18000;
				Base = 21621;
				Scale = -21;
				Formatter = "ColonTime";
			};
			Chance = {
				Max = 90;
				Base = 75;
				Scale = 0.03;
			};
		};
	};
	["Tranquil Pet Mutation"] = {
		Description = "<font color=\"rgb(247, 245, 184)\">TRANQUIL: Every <Cooldown>m, a nearby fruit finds inner peace, applying the Tranquil mutation!</font>";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 1200;
				Base = 1500;
				Scale = -3;
				Formatter = "ColonTime";
			};
			Chance = {
				Max = 30;
				Base = 20;
				Scale = 0.03;

		};
	};

I'll help you add these additional mutation options to your pet abilities. First, let me examine the current structure of your files to understand where these mutations should be added. Now let me check the structure to see where mutations are defined in the file. I need to see more of the file to find the mutation definitions section. Let me search for the mutation options section specifically: Let me search for where mutation data or options might be defined: Let me search for mutation data towards the end of the file: It looks like this file contains the pet abilities data, but I need to find where the mutations are defined. Let me check for a separate mutations section or if there's another data structure. Based on your request format with square brackets, it seems like this might be a different data structure format. Let me search for any existing mutation definitions: Looking at the format you provided, it seems like these are mutation definitions that need to be added to a different section or file. Let me check if there are any other files that might contain mutation data: Based on the structure I can see from your files, it looks like you want to add pet mutation options to your pet abilities system. Looking at the format you provided, these appear to be separate mutation definitions that would be used alongside the pet abilities. 

I need to understand where exactly these mutation options should be added. Let me check if there's a specific mutations section or if I need to create one. Looking at the format you provided, it seems like this should be a separate data structure. Let me add this as a new section in the `petAbilities.js` file. 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully added the additional pet mutation options to your `petAbilities.js` file. The new mutations include:

1. **Shocked Pet Mutation** - Attracts lightning during thunderstorms to shock nearby fruits
2. **Frozen Pet Mutation** - Has a chance to freeze nearby fruits 
3. **Windy Pet Mutation** - Has a chance to make nearby fruits Windstruck
4. **IronSkin Pet Mutation** - Provides protection against fruit theft by giving you stolen fruit as well
5. **Radiant Pet Mutation** - Emits sunshine to advance plant growth by 24 hours
6. **Ascended Pet Mutation** - Causes nearby fruits to ascend and apply Dawnbound mutation
7. **Tranquil Pet Mutation** - Helps nearby fruits find inner peace with Tranquil mutation

These mutations have been added as a separate `petMutationOptions` object at the end of the file, maintaining the exact structure and formatting you provided. Each mutation includes:

- **Description**: HTML-formatted text with color styling that describes the mutation effect
- **States**: Configuration objects with properties like Cooldown, Chance, Min/Max values, Base values, Scale factors, and Formatters where applicable

The mutations are now ready to be integrated with your pet system as additional abilities that can enhance pets beyond their inherent abilities!

I need those options added to the pets.html modifier dropdowns as well so their effects can be displayed with the pet's inherent ability.

I'll help you add the pet mutation options to the modifier dropdowns in the `pets.html` file. Let me first examine the current structure of the HTML file to understand how the dropdowns are implemented. Now I need to find the modifier dropdown sections and add the new pet mutation options. I can see there are multiple modifier dropdowns in the file:
