# Fixing percentage display to two decimal places (2025-09-18 17:10Z)

Percents should go to 2 decimal placs. Look at this one!

I can see from the attachment that there's a percentage display showing "20.9900000000000002x" which should be formatted to 2 decimal places. Let me examine the current `antiBeeEgg.js` file to understand how the percentage calculations are being done. I can see the issue! The percentage calculation in the `discobee` pet's calculate function is showing floating-point precision issues. The problem is that when displaying the chance percentage, it's not being rounded to 2 decimal places. Let me check the `Utils.formatTime` and other utility functions to see if there's a formatting function available, and then fix the percentage display. I can see that there's a `formatNumber` function, but I need to create a function specifically for formatting percentages to 2 decimal places. Looking at the Disco Bee calculation, the issue is that the `chance` variable is calculated as `14 + (1 * kg)` but when it's displayed, floating-point arithmetic can cause precision issues.

Let me check if there are other pets with similar percentage display issues by searching for percentage calculations: Great! I can see that many other pets are already using `.toFixed(1)` or `.toFixed(2)` for percentage formatting, but the Disco Bee in `antiBeeEgg.js` is missing this formatting. The issue is on line 164 where it shows `${chance}%` instead of `${chance.toFixed(2)}%`.

Let me fix this by updating the Disco Bee calculation to format the percentage to 2 decimal places: 
```

```
Perfect! I've fixed the Disco Bee percentage formatting to display with 2 decimal places using `.toFixed(2)`. This will resolve the floating-point precision issue you saw in the screenshot where it was showing "20.9900000000000002x" instead of "20.99%".

Now let me verify the fix by checking the updated file: Excellent! The fix has been applied successfully. Now the Disco Bee's percentage will display as "20.99%" instead of the floating-point precision error you encountered. 

The change I made:
- **Before**: `${chance}%` - This could show floating-point precision errors like "20.9900000000000002%"
- **After**: `${chance.toFixed(2)}%` - This will always show exactly 2 decimal places like "20.99%"

This follows the same pattern used by other pets in the codebase that also display percentages. You can now test this by starting the development server and checking the Disco Bee's abilities display!
