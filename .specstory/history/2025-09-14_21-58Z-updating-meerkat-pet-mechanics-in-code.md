# Updating Meerkat pet mechanics in code (2025-09-14 21:58Z)

_**User (2025-09-14 21:59Z)**_

Update Meerkat:
```
		Description = "Every <Cooldown>m goes to another pet and does a lookout. That pet advances cooldown by <Amount>s! Has a <Chance>% chance to do it again after each lookout.";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 15;
				Base = 444;
				Scale = -4.4;
				Formatter = "ColonTime";
			};
			Amount = {
				Base = 20;
				Scale = 0.5;
			};
			Chance = {
				Max = 100;
				Base = 15;
				Scale = 0.25;
			};
		};
```

I'll update the Meerkat pet in the oasisEgg.js file based on the new specification you provided. Let me analyze the changes needed:

1. The description needs to be updated to mention it goes to another pet and has a chance to repeat
2. The cooldown calculation changes from base 444 with -1 kg scale to base 444 with -4.4 kg scale
3. The advance amount changes from base 15 with 0.25 kg scale to base 20 with 0.5 kg scale  
4. A new chance mechanic is added with base 15% and 0.25% per kg scale 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully updated the Meerkat pet with the new specifications:

**Key changes made:**

1. **Description**: Updated to reflect that it "goes to another pet and does a lookout that advances their cooldown, with a chance to repeat"

2. **Cooldown calculation**: 
   - Changed the scaling from `-1 kg` to `-4.4 kg` per the new spec
   - Updated minimum from 40 seconds to 15 seconds to match the Min value

3. **Advance amount**: 
   - Changed from base `15 + (kg / 4)` to `20 + (0.5 * kg)` 
   - This matches the new Base = 20, Scale = 0.5 specification

4. **New chance mechanic**: 
   - Added a chance calculation: `Math.min(100, 15 + (0.25 * kg))`
   - This implements the Base = 15, Scale = 0.25, Max = 100 specification

5. **Display text**: Updated to show the new behavior including the chance to repeat after each lookout

6. **perKgImpact**: Updated to reflect all three scaling effects (cooldown, advance amount, and repeat chance)

The Meerkat now correctly implements the new game mechanics as specified in your configuration!
