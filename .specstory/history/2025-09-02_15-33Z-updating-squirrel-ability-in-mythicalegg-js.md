# Updating squirrel ability in mythicalEgg.js (2025-09-02 15:33Z)

Update the squirrel ability:
```
		Description = "<Chance>% chance to not consume a use when using the Reclaimer!";
		States = {
			Chance = {
				Base = 10;
				Scale = 0.3;
			};
```

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the squirrel ability according to your specifications. Looking at the current squirrel definition, I need to change it from a resource gathering ability to a Reclaimer use consumption prevention ability. 
```

```
I've successfully updated the squirrel ability with the following changes:

1. **Description**: Changed from "Gathers nuts for resource bonuses" to "Chance to not consume a use when using the Reclaimer"
2. **Base chance**: Set to 10% 
3. **Scale**: 0.3% per kg (as specified in your States.Chance.Scale)
4. **Calculation**: Now calculates the percentage chance to not consume Reclaimer uses instead of resource gathering bonuses
5. **Per kg impact**: Updated to reflect the new Reclaimer conservation mechanic

The squirrel will now provide a chance to preserve Reclaimer uses, starting at 10% base chance and increasing by 0.3% for each additional kg of weight.
