# Updating Disco Bee ability configuration (2025-09-11 17:34Z)

Update the Disco Bee:
```
		Description = "Every <Cooldown>m, <Chance>% chance a nearby fruit becomes Disco!";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 15;
				Base = 906;
				Scale = -12;
			};
			Chance = {
				Base = 14;
				Scale = 1;
			};
		};
    ```

I'll update the Disco Bee's ability based on the provided configuration. The new ability has a cooldown that decreases with weight and a chance that increases with weight for making nearby fruits "Disco". 
```

```
Perfect! I've updated the Disco Bee's ability according to the provided configuration:

**Changes made:**
- **Base cooldown**: Changed from 1610 seconds to 906 seconds
- **Cooldown scaling**: Changed from -16 seconds per kg to -12 seconds per kg  
- **Minimum cooldown**: Changed from 60 seconds to 15 seconds
- **New chance mechanic**: Added a percentage chance system starting at 14% base + 1% per kg
- **Description**: Updated to reflect the new "Disco fruit" ability instead of pollination and growth boost
- **Ability text**: Now shows the cooldown time and percentage chance for making fruits "Disco"

The Disco Bee now has a chance-based ability that triggers every cooldown period, with both the cooldown decreasing and the success chance increasing as the pet gets heavier. This follows the exact formula from your configuration:
- Cooldown: `max(15, 906 - (12 * kg))` seconds
- Chance: `14 + (1 * kg)`%
