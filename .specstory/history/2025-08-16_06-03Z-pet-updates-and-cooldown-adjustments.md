I'll help you update the pet data with these cooldown and stat changes. First, let me understand what we're working with by examining the current structure.

Please add the files containing the pet data to the working set, or use `#codebase` in your request to automatically discover the working set files that need to be modified for these pet updates.

Once I can see the current pet data structure, I'll be able to make the precise updates for:

- **Bee**: Cooldown Min 60.00 → 150.00
- **Brown Mouse**: Cooldown Min 10.00 → 60.00  
- **Butterfly**: Cooldown Min 15.00 → 180.00
- **Capybara**: Amount Max created at 25.00
- **Cat**: Cooldown Min 5.00 → 20.00, Range Max created at 20.00, Multiplier Max created at 4.00, Duration Max created at 20.00
- **Chicken Zombie**: Cooldown Min 10.00 → 160.00
- **Cooked Owl**: Cooldown Min 15.00 → 60.00
- **Crab**: Cooldown Min 15.00 → 30.00
- **Dilophosaurus**: Cooldown Min 60.00 → 80.00, Amount XP Max 1500.00 → 2500.00
- **Disco Bee**: Cooldown Min 15.00 → 60.00

I can see you're working on pet data updates, but I need to see the actual files in the `/Users/wayne/source/gagpets` folder to make the specific changes you mentioned.

Please add the files containing the pet data (likely JSON, TypeScript, or similar configuration files) to the working set, or use `#codebase` in your request so I can automatically discover and examine the files that contain the pet statistics.

Once I can see the current structure and locate pets like "Bee", "Brown Mouse", "Butterfly", etc., I'll be able to update their cooldown times and other stats according to your specifications.
