# Adding source information to pet files (2025-08-15 01:07Z)

_**User**_

Please add the following source information (if it is missing) to the appropriate files in the pets folder:

Source	Pet	Probability	Obtainable?
Event	Bald Eagle	N/A	No
Event	Hamster	N/A	No
Event	Football	N/A	No
Quest	Corrupted Kodama	4.35%	No
Event	Raiju	N/A	No
Unreleased	Mizuchi	N/A	No

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you add the missing source information to the appropriate files in the pets folder. Let me first examine the current pets folder structure and check for these specific pets to see which files they belong to. Now let me search for each of these pets across the pets files to determine which file they belong to: Perfect! I found all the pets. Let me search for "Corrupted Kodama" more specifically to find the exact property name: Let me get more context around the Corrupted Kodama to find its property name: Now let me examine each file to see what source information is already present and what needs to be added. Let me start by checking the current structure of each pet entry: Now let me check if there are any existing source fields in these files to understand the pattern: Great! I can see that the files do use a `source:` field. Now let me also check if they have `obtainable:` and `probability:` fields: Perfect! Now I can see the pattern. The pets have three fields for source information:
1. `source:` - the source type
2. `probability:` - the probability (as a number, or 0 for N/A)
3. `obtainable:` - boolean for whether it's obtainable

Now let me check the current state of each pet to see what's missing: Now I can see that none of these pets have source information. Let me also check if there are duplicates by checking the `mammals.js` file to see if there's a hamster there as well: I can see there are duplicate hamsters. Let me also check if there are duplicate raiju entries by checking if there's one in other.js: Perfect! Now I have a complete picture. There are duplicates:

1. **Hamster**: in both `smallMammals.js` and `mammals.js`
2. **Raiju**: in both `mythical.js` and `other.js` 
3. **Mizuchi**: in both `mythical.js` and `other.js`

I need to add source information to all the pets mentioned. Let me check if any of them already have source information by looking at a broader context: Let me check around the structure to see where to place the source information by looking at an example in the same file: Perfect! I can see the pattern. The source information goes right after the `description` field and before the `calculate` function. Now I'll add the missing source information to each pet. 

Let me start with the Bald Eagle in birds_new.js: 
```

```
Now let me add the source information to the Hamster in smallMammals.js: 
```

```
Now I need to check if there's a hamster in `mammals.js` that also needs to be updated. Let me check the context around that hamster: I should add source information to this hamster too: 
```

```
Now let me add source information to the Football in other.js: 
```

```
Now let me add source information to the Corrupted Kodama in other.js: 
```

```
Now let me add source information to the Raiju in other.js: 
```

```
Now let me add source information to the Mizuchi in other.js: 
```

```
Now let me add source information to the Raiju in mythical.js: 
```

```
Finally, let me add source information to the Mizuchi in mythical.js: 
```

```
Perfect! I have successfully added the source information to all the requested pets. Let me provide a summary of what was completed:

## Summary of Changes

I've successfully added the missing source information to all the requested pets in the appropriate files:

### Pets Updated:

1. **Bald Eagle** (in `birds_new.js`)
   - Source: "Event"
   - Probability: 0 (N/A)
   - Obtainable: false (No)

2. **Hamster** (in both `smallMammals.js` and `mammals.js`)
   - Source: "Event"
   - Probability: 0 (N/A)
   - Obtainable: false (No)

3. **Football** (in `other.js`)
   - Source: "Event"
   - Probability: 0 (N/A)
   - Obtainable: false (No)

4. **Corrupted Kodama** (in `other.js`)
   - Source: "Quest"
   - Probability: 4.35
   - Obtainable: false (No)

5. **Raiju** (in both `mythical.js` and `other.js`)
   - Source: "Event"
   - Probability: 0 (N/A)
   - Obtainable: false (No)

6. **Mizuchi** (in both `mythical.js` and `other.js`)
   - Source: "Unreleased"
   - Probability: 0 (N/A)
   - Obtainable: false (No)

### Files Modified:
- `birds_new.js`
- `smallMammals.js`
- `mammals.js`
- `other.js`
- `mythical.js`

All source information has been added following the existing pattern used in the codebase, with the fields placed after the `description` and before the `calculate` function. The probability values were converted from the table format (N/A = 0, 4.35% = 4.35) and obtainable status was set to `false` for all "No" entries.
