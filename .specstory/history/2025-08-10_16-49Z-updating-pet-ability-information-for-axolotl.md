_**Assistant**_

I'll add the Bacon Pig and Bagel Bunny pet abilities to the `petAbilities.js` file. Let me find a good place to insert them and add the entries. 
```

```
I've successfully added the Bacon Pig and Bagel Bunny pet abilities to the `petAbilities.js` file. Here's what I added:

**Bacon Pig:**
- **Ability:** Bacon Frenzy
- **Effect:** Emits an aura every 120s (reduced by 1s per kg, minimum 5s) for 15s (+ 0.15s per kg) that grants 2x (+ 0.01x per kg) chance for new fruit to grow as variants within 15 studs (+ 0.15 per kg)
- **Type:** Mammal, Legendary rarity
- **Icon:** Placeholder with üê∑ fallback (ready for you to add the image URL)

**Bagel Bunny:**
- **Ability:** Bagel and Carrots  
- **Effect:** Eats a carrot every 45s (reduced by 1s per kg, minimum 5s) for 5x (+ 0.05x per kg) value bonus
- **Type:** Herbivore, Legendary rarity
- **Icon:** Placeholder with ü•Ø fallback (ready for you to add the image URL)

Both pets follow the same structure and formatting as the existing pets in the file, with proper modifier support and detailed impact descriptions. The image URLs are left empty as placeholders for you to fill in when you add the images.

_**Assistant**_

I'll check the current file contents first and then add these new pet abilities. Now let me look for the end of the pet abilities to add the new pets: Let me find where the main pet abilities section ends to add the new pets: Now I need to add the new pets before the closing brace. Let me check what specific pets need to be added and updated:

1. **Corrupted Kodama** - new pet
2. **Deer** - update existing
3. **Dilophosaurus** - update existing  
4. **French Fry Ferret** - new pet
5. **Kodama** - new pet
6. **Mochi Mouse** - update existing

Let me add the new pets first: 
```

```
Now I need to update the existing pets. Let me find and update the Deer pet: The Deer entry already matches the data provided (max 5%, calculation looks correct). Let me check the Dilophosaurus entry: The Dilophosaurus entry already has the XP max at 1500, which matches the data. Now let me find and check the Mochi Mouse entry (it should already be updated based on the previous data): Perfect! All the pets from your data have been successfully added or updated:

## Summary of Changes Made:

### **New Pets Added:**
1. **Corrupted Kodama** - Spirit type, Mythical rarity
   - 6% base chance (max 12%) for Zen type fruit to get Corrupt mutation after collecting
   - +0.33% chance per kg

2. **French Fry Ferret** - Food type, Prismatic rarity  
   - Increases random pet level by 1 every 3632 seconds (reduced by 36s per kg, minimum 1200s)
   - Cannot be mimicked or refreshed

3. **Kodama** - Spirit type, Legendary rarity
   - 6% base chance (max 12%) for Zen type fruit to get Tranquil mutation after collecting
   - +0.33% chance per kg

### **Existing Pets Already Correctly Configured:**
- **Deer** - Berry preservation chance max 5% ‚úÖ
- **Dilophosaurus** - XP grant max 1500 ‚úÖ  
- **Mochi Mouse** - Base XP bonus 0.75 for Food type pets ‚úÖ

All the new pets are ready with placeholder image URLs that you can fill in when you add the images. The abilities follow the same structure and formatting as existing pets, with proper modifier support and detailed impact descriptions.

_**Assistant**_

I'll check the current file contents and then update the existing pets and add the new Pancake Mole pet. I need to update the Mole entry to set the minimum to 10 seconds. Let me fix that: 
```

```
Now let me check and update the Moon Cat entry: I need to update the Moon Cat to change the size multiplier calculation from 0.01x per kg to 0.02x per kg: 
```

```
Wait, I need to actually change the calculation too, not just the description. Let me fix that: 
```

```
Now let me check and update the Nihonzaru entry: The Nihonzaru entry already looks correct with the base 2%, max 6%, and 0.1% per kg (kg/10). Now let me check the Pancake Mole entry: I need to update the Pancake Mole to add the minimum 10 seconds info in the perKgImpact: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully updated all the pets from your data:

## Summary of Changes Made:

### **Updated Pets:**

1. **Mole** ‚úÖ
   - Changed minimum cooldown from 1 second to 10 seconds
   - Updated perKgImpact description to mention minimum

2. **Moon Cat** ‚úÖ
   - Updated size multiplier calculation from +0.01x per kg (kg/50) to +0.02x per kg
   - Updated perKgImpact description accordingly

3. **Nihonzaru** ‚úÖ
   - Already correctly configured: 2% base, 6% max, 0.1% per kg

4. **Pancake Mole** ‚úÖ
   - Already correctly configured: 80s base cooldown, -1s per kg, 10s minimum
   - Updated perKgImpact description to mention minimum

All pets now match the specifications in your data:
- **Mole**: Minimum 10s cooldown
- **Moon Cat**: 0.02x size multiplier per kg  
- **Nihonzaru**: 2-6% passive boost range
- **Pancake Mole**: 80s base with 10s minimum, treasure hunting ability

The changes maintain consistency with the existing code structure and formatting.

_**Assistant**_

I'll check the current file and update these pets. Let me start by finding the existing entries: I need to update the perKgImpact to mention the minimum: 
```

```
Now let me check the Spotted Deer: The Spotted Deer already has the correct max of 10%. Now let me check the Sushi Bear: I notice there's an issue with the Sushi Bear calculation. Based on the data provided, the feeding amount should be:
- Base: 0.01 (1%)
- Max: 0.50 (50%) 
- Per kg: 0.00 (no increase per kg)

Let me fix this: 
```

```
