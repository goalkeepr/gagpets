# Updating filter label in HTML file (2025-08-15 04:14Z)

_**User**_

I want to replace the Filter by Pet Type with Filter by Source Type

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you replace "Filter by Pet Type" with "Filter by Source Type" in your project. Let me first search for where this text appears in your codebase. Great! I found the text "Filter by Pet Type" in the `pets.html` file. Let me examine that file to see the context and make the replacement. Perfect! I can see the line that needs to be changed. Now I'll replace "Filter by Pet Type:" with "Filter by Source Type:" in the HTML file. 
```

```
Great! I've successfully replaced "Filter by Pet Type:" with "Filter by Source Type:" in the `pets.html` file. The change has been made to line 31 of the file, where the label text was updated from "Filter by Pet Type:" to "Filter by Source Type:".

The replacement is now complete. The filter label in your pet calculator interface will now display "Filter by Source Type" instead of "Filter by Pet Type".

_**User**_

You misunderstood. I want to be able to filter by the source types specified in the file files in the pets folder (Common Egg, Legendary Egg, etc.)

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand now! You want to replace the pet type filtering (mammals, birds, etc.) with source type filtering (Common Egg, Legendary Egg, etc.). Let me first explore the pets folder to understand the source types available. Perfect! Now I can see the source types available. Let me examine a couple of these files to understand their structure and see what source types are available. Great! Now I can see that each pet has a `source` property. Let me search for all the unique source types in the codebase to get a complete list. Let me check what other source types exist by looking at the main `petAbilities.js` file to see all available sources: Let me search for "source" more broadly to understand the structure: Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the source types. Based on my analysis, I can see that pets have a `source` property with values like:
- Common Egg
- Uncommon Egg  
- Rare Egg
- Legendary Egg
- Mythical Egg
- Primal Egg
- Common Summer Egg
- Rare Summer Egg
- Bug Egg
- Dinosaur Egg
- Night Egg
- And more...

Now I need to update the HTML to replace the pet type filtering with source type filtering. Let me modify the `pets.html` file: 
```

```
Now I need to update the JavaScript code to handle source-based filtering instead of type-based filtering. Let me find and update the filtering functions in the JavaScript section of the HTML file: I need to update the `getFilteredPets` function to filter by source instead of type. Let me find the exact location and update it: 
```

```
Now I need to add the `isKnownSource` helper function and update or replace the `getPetCategory` function since we're no longer using type categories. Let me find where these functions are defined: I need to replace the `getPetCategory` function with `isKnownSource` function. Let me update it: 
```

```
Now I need to find and update the event handlers that are still referencing the old type filtering logic. Let me search for where the filtering events are handled: I need to update the event handlers to use the new `setSourceFilter` function. Let me find and update these references: 
```

```
Now I need to also update the dropdown display function to show source information instead of type information. Let me find the `displayDropdown` function: I need to update the dropdown display to show source information instead of type. Let me update the `displayDropdown` function: 
```

```
I also need to update the grid display to show source information. Let me find and update the `displayGrid` function: Let me update the grid display to show source instead of type: 
```

```
I should also remove the `getTypeDisplayName` function since it's no longer being used. Let me find it and see if it's still referenced anywhere: Since it's only defined but no longer used, let me remove the `getTypeDisplayName` function: 
```

```
Now let me update the CSS to ensure the new `.pet-source` class is styled properly. Let me check if there are any specific styles for `.pet-type` that need to be updated: Let me check for CSS styles that might be affecting the pet grid: The styling should automatically work since `.pet-source` will replace `.pet-type` in the same position. Let me also check if there are any other references to type filtering that need to be updated. Let me test the page to see if it works properly now.

Actually, let me check if there's any additional logic I might have missed by looking for comments or references about type filtering: Good, it looks like the HTML elements are correctly updated. Let me check if there are any comments or other references that need updating: Let me update the comment to reflect that it's now source filtering: 
```

```
Now let me also check if there are any variable names that reference "type" that should be updated to "source": For consistency, I should rename the ID from `typeFilterSelect` to `sourceFilterSelect`. However, since this is a significant change and might break existing references, let me leave the ID as is but update the variable names in the comments to be more accurate. Let me verify there are no other missing pieces by searching for any remaining references to type categories: Great! It looks like I've successfully replaced all the pet type filtering references. Let me verify that there are no other missing areas by checking if there are any remaining references to specific animal types in filtering contexts: Perfect! Now let me summarize what I've successfully updated:

## Summary of Changes Made

I have successfully replaced the "Filter by Pet Type" functionality with "Filter by Source Type" filtering in your `pets.html` file. Here are the key changes:

### 1. **HTML Label Updated**
- Changed "Filter by Pet Type:" to "Filter by Source Type:"

### 2. **Filter Options Updated**
- **Mobile dropdown**: Replaced mammal/bird/insect options with egg source types (Common Egg, Legendary Egg, etc.)
- **Desktop buttons**: Updated to show source-based filtering options with appropriate emojis

### 3. **JavaScript Logic Updated**
- **`getFilteredPets()`**: Now filters by `pet.source` instead of `pet.type`
- **`setSourceFilter()`**: Renamed from `setTypeFilter()` to reflect new functionality
- **`isKnownSource()`**: New helper function to identify known egg sources vs "other"
- **Event handlers**: Updated to use `setSourceFilter()` instead of `setTypeFilter()`

### 4. **Display Updates**
- **Dropdown display**: Now shows source information in pet options
- **Grid display**: Shows source instead of type in pet cards
- **Tooltips**: Updated to show source information

### 5. **Available Source Types**
The filter now includes these source categories:
- ü•ö Common Egg
- ü•ö Uncommon Egg  
- ü•ö Rare Egg
- ü•ö Legendary Egg
- ü•ö Mythical Egg
- ü•ö Primal Egg
- üèñÔ∏è Common Summer Egg
- üèñÔ∏è Rare Summer Egg
- üêõ Bug Egg
- ü¶ï Dinosaur Egg
- üåô Night Egg
- üîÆ Other (for any sources not in the known list)

The filtering system now allows users to filter pets based on where they come from (their source/egg type) rather than what type of animal they are, which should provide a more useful way to categorize and find pets based on how they're obtained in the game.

I have images for each of the sources. Can the source filter buttons use png images instead of emojis?

---

_**Assistant**_

I can help you replace the emoji icons with PNG images for the source filter buttons. First, let me understand where your images are located and what they're named. Could you tell me:

1. Where are the source images stored in your project?
2. What are the filenames for each source type?

In the meantime, let me look at your current project structure to see if I can find where images are typically stored: Let me check if there's an images folder or if images are stored elsewhere: I can see that the project uses external images from wikia. Let me check if there are local images in the data folder or if there's a specific pattern for source images: Let me check if there are any source images references or if you have a pattern for source-specific images: Let me search more broadly for egg-related images: Since I don't see specific source images defined yet, I'll show you how to modify the code to use PNG images instead of emojis. You can either:

1. **Option A: Use local images** - Store PNG files in your project
2. **Option B: Use external URLs** - Use images hosted elsewhere (like your wikia URLs)

Let me provide a solution that's flexible for both approaches. I'll create a mapping object for source icons and update the filter buttons: 
```

```
Now I need to update the HTML to use the new icon function for both the mobile dropdown and desktop buttons: Let me check the exact formatting of the HTML section I need to update: I see there are some encoding issues with the emojis. Let me update the buttons one by one. First, let me update the mobile dropdown: Let me try a more targeted approach, updating each button individually: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Let me continue with the rest of the buttons: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Let me find and update the remaining buttons. First, let me check what's left: I need to find and update the Mythical Egg and Other buttons: Let me try with a different approach since there seems to be an encoding issue: Let me try updating them individually: 
```

```
Now let me try to find and update the Mythical button by searching for different patterns: Let me try to replace by including more context: Let me try a different approach - I'll add JavaScript to initialize the source icons after the page loads. Let me add this functionality to the EventHandlers init: Let me find the EventHandlers object and add the initialization there: I'll add the source icon initialization to the EventHandlers init method: 
```

```
Now I need to add the `initializeSourceIcons` method to the EventHandlers object. Let me find where to add it: Let me find the end of the EventHandlers object: Perfect! I can add the new method right before the closing brace of the EventHandlers object: 
```

```
Now let me manually fix the Mythical Egg button. First, let me find its exact line: I can see the encoding issue. Let me try a different approach - I'll replace based on the data-type attribute: Let me try with a more robust approach - I'll add CSS to hide the corrupt emoji and use JavaScript to handle this specific case: 
```

```
Perfect! Now I have successfully set up the framework to use PNG images instead of emojis for the source filter buttons. Here's what I've implemented:

## Summary of Changes

### 1. **Source Icon Mapping System**
I've added a `SOURCE_ICONS` object that maps each source type to its PNG image URL. Currently, it contains placeholder URLs that you need to replace with your actual image paths.

### 2. **Helper Function**
Created `getSourceIconHTML()` function that:
- Takes a source type and returns an `<img>` tag with the proper URL
- Includes fallback emoji support if the image fails to load
- Handles sizing and styling automatically

### 3. **Button Updates**
- Updated all desktop filter buttons to use `<span class="source-icon-placeholder">` elements
- Added automatic initialization that replaces these placeholders with actual images on page load
- Handled the encoding issue with the Mythical Egg button specifically

### 4. **Mobile Dropdown**
- Cleaned up the mobile dropdown to remove emojis (since HTML in option tags isn't well-supported across browsers)

## Next Steps

**You need to update the image URLs in the `SOURCE_ICONS` object** (around line 280 in the file). Replace the placeholder URLs with your actual image paths. For example:

```javascript
const SOURCE_ICONS = {
    'Common Egg': './images/common-egg.png',          // or your actual path
    'Uncommon Egg': './images/uncommon-egg.png',
    'Rare Egg': './images/rare-egg.png',
    'Legendary Egg': './images/legendary-egg.png',
    'Mythical Egg': './images/mythical-egg.png',
    'Primal Egg': './images/primal-egg.png',
    'Common Summer Egg': './images/common-summer-egg.png',
    'Rare Summer Egg': './images/rare-summer-egg.png',
    'Bug Egg': './images/bug-egg.png',
    'Dinosaur Egg': './images/dinosaur-egg.png',
    'Night Egg': './images/night-egg.png',
    'other': './images/other-source.png'
};
```

The system will automatically:
- Display your PNG images in the filter buttons
- Fall back to emoji if any image fails to load
- Handle the sizing (16px by default) and styling
- Work with both existing and future source types

Just tell me where your source images are located, and I can update the URLs accordingly!

I have updated the image urls for the listed eggs. However, you appear to be missing:
* Anti Bee
* Bee
* Gourmet
* Oasis
* Paradise
* Zen

---

_**Assistant**_

I need to check the current state of the `pets.html` file to see what you've updated and then add the missing source types. Let me first examine the current SOURCE_ICONS object: Perfect! I can see you've updated the image URLs. Now I need to add the missing source types. Let me also check what source types exist in your pets files to make sure I include all of them: Let me get a more comprehensive list of all source types: Perfect! I can see all the source types from the search results. Let me now add the 6 missing source types to the `SOURCE_ICONS` object and the filter UI. Now let me add the 6 missing source types to the SOURCE_ICONS object: 
```

```
Now I need to find where the filter options are defined and add the missing source types. Let me check the HTML for the filter buttons: Let me search for filter button HTML structure: Let me read the desktop filter buttons section to understand the current structure: I notice there's a corrupted character in the Mythical Egg button. Let me also find the mobile dropdown section: Now I need to add the 6 missing source types to both the mobile dropdown and desktop buttons. Let me first add them to the mobile dropdown: Let me check the exact format with corrupted characters: I can see there are corrupted emoji characters. Let me try adding the missing options one by one by inserting after the Night Egg option: 
```

```
Now let me add the missing options to the desktop buttons. I need to add them before the "Other" button: 
```

```
Now I need to fix the corrupted Mythical Egg button by adding the proper placeholder: Let me check the current state of the Mythical Egg button: Let me try to replace with more context: Let me use grep to find the exact text with the corrupted character: I can see there's a special handling for the Mythical button at line 1774! Let me check the JavaScript code to see how it's being handled: Good! The Mythical Egg button is already being handled properly in JavaScript. Now I need to update the `isKnownSource` function to include the new source types. Let me find this function: Perfect! Now I need to add the 6 missing source types to the `isKnownSource` function: 
```

```
Perfect! Now I've successfully added all 6 missing source types to the filter system:

## ‚úÖ **All Missing Source Types Added Successfully!**

I've completed adding the 6 missing source types you mentioned:

### **Added to SOURCE_ICONS object:**
- ‚úÖ `'Anti Bee Egg': 'PLACEHOLDER_URL_ANTI_BEE_EGG'`

- ‚úÖ Filtering system will properly categorize pets from these sources

### **üìã Next Steps for You:**
You can now replace the placeholder URLs in the `SOURCE_ICONS` object with your actual image URLs:

```javascript
'Anti Bee Egg': 'YOUR_ANTI_BEE_EGG_IMAGE_URL',
'Bee Egg': 'YOUR_BEE_EGG_IMAGE_URL',
'Gourmet Egg': 'YOUR_GOURMET_EGG_IMAGE_URL',
'Oasis Egg': 'YOUR_OASIS_EGG_IMAGE_URL',
'Paradise Egg': 'YOUR_PARADISE_EGG_IMAGE_URL',
'Zen Egg': 'YOUR_ZEN_EGG_IMAGE_URL'
```

The filtering system is now complete with all available source types from your pet data! üéâ
