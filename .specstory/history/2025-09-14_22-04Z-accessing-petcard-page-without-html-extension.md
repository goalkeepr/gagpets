# Accessing petcard page without .html extension (2025-09-14 22:04Z)

_**User (2025-09-14 22:05Z)**_

Is it possible to view the petcard page by going to petcard?querystring instead of petcard.html?querystring?

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

I'll help you check if it's possible to access the petcard page without the `.html` extension. Let me examine the server configuration to see how routes are handled. Based on the server configuration I can see, the current setup only handles specific routes without the `.html` extension:

- `/` → serves `pets.html`
- `/recipes` → serves `recipes.html` 
- `/fruittypes` → serves `fruittypes.html`

However, there's **no route defined for `/petcard`** to serve `petcard.html`. Currently, you can only access the petcard page via `/petcard.html?querystring`.

To enable access via `/petcard?querystring`, I can add a route to the server. Let me add this functionality: 
```

```
Perfect! I've added a route for `/petcard` that serves the `petcard.html` file. Now you can access the petcard page using either:

1. **With extension**: `/petcard.html?pet=bunny&weight=50&age=25&mutation=none`
2. **Without extension**: `/petcard?pet=bunny&weight=50&age=25&mutation=none`

The route will preserve all query string parameters, so both URLs will work identically. The server will serve the same `petcard.html` file regardless of which URL format you use.

To test this, you'll need to restart your server: The change has been made! Once you restart your server, you'll be able to access the petcard page without the `.html` extension. Both URLs will work:

- `http://localhost:8029/petcard?pet=bunny&weight=50&age=25&mutation=none` ✅ (new)
- `http://localhost:8029/petcard.html?pet=bunny&weight=50&age=25&mutation=none` ✅ (existing)

This follows the same pattern as your other routes (`/`, `/recipes`, `/fruittypes`) and makes the URL cleaner and more user-friendly.

I have updated the server.js routes to use /petcard in addition to /petcard.html. Change all references from /petcard.html to /petcard

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

I'll help you update all references from `petcard.html` to `/petcard` in the codebase. Let me first search for all occurrences of `petcard.html` to see what needs to be changed. Now let me look at the specific files that need updates. I can see references in `pets.html`, `server.js`, and `test-petcard-url.html`. Let me update these files: 
```

```

```

```
Let me check the test file to see its exact content and fix the replacement: Now I can fix the test file properly: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully updated all references from `petcard.html` to `/petcard` in the following files:

## Files Updated:

1. **`pets.html`** - Updated the `buildCardUrl` function in the `PetCardManager` to generate URLs using `/petcard` instead of `petcard.html`

2. **`server.js`** - Updated the screenshot API endpoint to use `/petcard` when building the pet card URL for Puppeteer navigation

3. **`test-petcard-url.html`** - Updated the test file to use `/petcard` instead of `petcard.html`

## Summary of Changes:

- **Pet Card URL Generation**: The main pets page now generates pet card links using the cleaner `/petcard` URL format
- **Screenshot API**: The server's screenshot endpoint now navigates to `/petcard` URLs when generating images
- **Test Files**: Test utilities have been updated to use the new URL format

All instances now use the cleaner `/petcard?querystring` format instead of `/petcard.html?querystring`, which makes the URLs more user-friendly and consistent with your other routes (`/`, `/recipes`, `/fruittypes`).

The changes maintain full backward compatibility since your `server.js` already serves the same `petcard.html` file for both URL formats.
