# Would it be possible to add a section above the ou (2025-07-12 00:58Z)

Would it be possible to add a section above the output section that reads, "each additional kg does XXX" - This information can be derived from the formula for each pet. For example, for Snail might read, "Each additional kg adds 0.05% change to drop seeds."

I'll analyze the pet formulas and add a section that shows how each additional kilogram affects the pet's abilities. Let me examine the current code and implement this feature. 
````

Now I need to update the pet abilities data to include the per-kg impact calculations and modify the Calculator to display this information: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Now I need to continue with the remaining pets. Let me add the perKgImpact for the rest: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Now I need to update the DOMManager to include the new impact result elements: Let me search for the exact DOMManager init function: Let me read the file around line 715 to see the DOMManager init function: I can see the elements are already being added. Now I need to update the clearResults function to include the impact result: Let me search for the clearResults function: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

@agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

_**Assistant**_

I see the clearResults function already includes the impactResultDiv. Now I need to update the Calculator to show the impact information. Let me find the Calculator functions: Now I need to modify the Calculator to show the impact information. Let me update the handleSingleMode function: 
```
