I'll check the current recipes in your HTML file against the source data you provided. Let me first read the current recipes file to see what's implemented. Now let me also check the `recipe_data.js` file to see if there's any additional data there: Now I need to analyze the differences between the source data you provided and what's implemented in the HTML file. Let me create a comprehensive comparison: Let me analyze the source data structure first. I can see there are several critical differences between your source data and the current implementation: ## Recipe Accuracy Analysis

After comparing your source data with the current HTML implementation, I found several **critical inaccuracies**:

### **Major Issues Found:**

1. **Missing Key Recipes:** The source data includes `CandyApple` and `SweetTea` which are properly implemented in the HTML.

2. **Incorrect Meat Ingredient Lists:** The biggest issue is with the `tbl` reference in your source data. The HTML uses a hardcoded meat list that doesn't match what `tbl` would contain.

3. **Pizza Recipe Missing Sauce Requirement:** In the source data, Pizza requires 4 ingredients including `Sauce = PlantTraitsData.Traits.Fruit`, but the HTML implementation shows 3 ingredients.

4. **Missing Plant Trait Expansions:** Several recipes reference `PlantTraitsData.Traits.X` which should expand to specific plant lists, but some are incorrectly implemented. ### **Detailed Recipe-by-Recipe Analysis:**

**❌ INCORRECT RECIPES:**

1. **Corndog**: 
   - **Source**: Requires `Meat = tbl` 
   - **HTML**: Has hardcoded meat list that may not match `tbl`
   - **Issue**: Unknown what `tbl` contains exactly

2. **HotDog**:
   - **Source**: Requires `Meat = tbl`
   - **HTML**: Same hardcoded meat list issue

3. **Pizza**:
   - **Source**: Requires 4 ingredients (Bread, Meat=tbl, Vegetable, Sauce)
   - **HTML**: Shows 3 ingredients, missing Sauce requirement
   - **Issue**: Ingredient count wrong AND missing Sauce

4. **Burger, Pie, Spaghetti**: All have the same `tbl` meat reference issue

5. **SweetTea**:
   - **Source**: `HerbalBase = TableUtils:MakeTable(TableUtils:SetSubtract(PlantTraitsData.Traits.Flower, PlantTraitsData.Traits.Toxic), "Mint")`
   - **HTML**: Simplified to `"'Flower' type plant", "Mint"`
   - **Issue**: Should exclude toxic flowers, but HTML doesn't handle this exclusion

**✅ CORRECT RECIPES:**
- Soup, Sandwich, Salad, Waffle, Donut, IceCream, Cake, Smoothie, Porridge, CandyApple ### **Critical Questions for Accuracy:**

To make the recipes 100% accurate, I need clarification on:

1. **What does `tbl` contain?** This appears to be a meat list used in multiple recipes (Corndog, HotDog, Burger, Pie, Pizza, Spaghetti).

2. **Complete Plant Traits Data**: The HTML has a `fruitTypesData` object, but I need to confirm if it includes all the trait categories referenced in your source.

3. **SweetTea Toxic Exclusion**: Should toxic flowers be excluded from the herbal base options?

### **Recommended Fixes:** ## **Summary: Recipes Need Major Corrections**

**Status: ❌ NOT ACCURATE**

The recipes in your HTML file have several critical errors that need to be fixed:

1. **Pizza recipe is missing the Sauce requirement** (should be 4 ingredients, not 3)
2. **Multiple recipes using unknown `tbl` meat list** - needs clarification
3. **SweetTea should exclude toxic flowers** from herbal base options
4. **Ingredient counts don't match source data** for several recipes

**Next Steps Needed:**
1. **Provide the contents of `tbl`** (the meat ingredient list)
2. **Confirm complete PlantTraitsData.Traits** structure
3. **Clarify toxic flower exclusion logic** for SweetTea

Would you like me to implement the fixes once you provide the missing `tbl` data and confirm the plant traits structure?

tbl (Meat) should be "{"Pepper", "Bell Pepper", "Ember Lily", "Cactus", "Mushroom", "Eggplant", "Venus Fly Trap", "Glowshroom", "Bone Blossom", "Tall Asparagus", "Taco Fern"}" 

I apoligize for my mistake.

_**Assistant**_

Thank you for providing the `tbl` (Meat) ingredient list! Now I can accurately fix the recipes. Let me update the HTML file to match the source data exactly. First, let me fix the meat ingredient lists. I notice there's a typo in the current HTML - "Venus Flytrap" should be "Venus Fly Trap" to match your source data: Let me be more specific by including more context around the Burger recipe: 
```

```
Now let me fix the Corndog recipe: 
```

```
Wait, I need to fix the Corndog recipe count. According to the source data, it should have 3 ingredient types but the Count is 2. Let me check the source again - it has Stick, Meat, and Batter, but the Count is 2. This suggests the Count refers to the number of individual items needed, not ingredient types. Let me continue with the other fixes:
