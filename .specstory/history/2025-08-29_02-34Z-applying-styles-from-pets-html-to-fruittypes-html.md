Apply the style from pets.html to fruittypes.html

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you apply the style from `pets.html` to fruittypes.html. Let me first examine both files to understand the current styling and then apply the necessary changes. Now let me read the current `fruittypes.html` file to see what styling needs to be applied: Now I can see that the `fruittypes.html` file already has most of the basic structure and styling from pets.html, but it's missing the dark mode toggle functionality and some specific styling elements. Let me check what specific styles need to be added by looking at the CSS file to understand the dark mode implementation: Let me continue reading the CSS file to see the dark mode toggle styles: Let me read the specific dark mode toggle CSS section: Now I need to apply the styling from `pets.html` to fruittypes.html. I can see that the main missing element is the dark mode toggle button in the header. Let me update the `fruittypes.html` file: 
```

```
Now I need to add the dark mode toggle JavaScript functionality. Let me add this to the script section: 
```

```
Now I need to add the dark mode toggle methods to the FruitTypesApp class: 
```

```
Now I need to ensure the dark mode variables are properly applied to the custom styles for the fruit types page. Let me update the styles in the `fruittypes.html` file to use CSS custom properties: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Let me also add the fadeInUp animation that's used in the styles: 
```

```
Now let me test the updated `fruittypes.html` file to see if the styling has been successfully applied: Let me start a local server to test the file: Perfect! I've successfully applied the style from `pets.html` to fruittypes.html. Here's a summary of the changes I made:

## Changes Applied:

1. **Added Dark Mode Toggle Button**: Added the dark mode toggle button to the header with the same styling and functionality as pets.html.

2. **Updated CSS Variables**: Modified the styles to use CSS custom properties for better dark mode support:
   - Changed `background: white` to `background: var(--card-bg)`
   - Updated search input to use `var(--input-bg)` and `var(--text-color)`
   - Changed hardcoded colors to use CSS variables like `var(--result-bg)`, `var(--border-color)`, etc.
   - Updated search highlight to use `var(--secondary-color)`

3. **Added Dark Mode JavaScript**: Implemented the complete dark mode toggle functionality including:
   - `setupDarkModeToggle()` method
   - `setTheme()` method
   - Event listeners for the toggle button
   - localStorage persistence
   - System theme preference detection

4. **Added Animations**: Added the `fadeInUp` keyframe animation for smooth transitions.

The `fruittypes.html` file now has the same dark mode styling and functionality as pets.html, with:
- A functioning dark/light mode toggle button in the top-right corner
- Proper color scheme transitions
- Theme persistence across page reloads
- Respect for system theme preferences
- Smooth animations and transitions

You can test the dark mode by clicking the moon/sun icon in the top-right corner of the page. The theme will automatically save and persist across page refreshes.
