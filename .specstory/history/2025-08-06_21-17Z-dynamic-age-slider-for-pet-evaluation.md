# Dynamic age slider for pet evaluation (2025-08-06 21:17Z)

_**User**_

When only one pet is being evaluated, instead of just a weight entry, I would like a slider from age 1-100. The user will enter an age and weight, and then the weight and ability information will be dynamically updated when the user moves the slider.

Okay, I'll add an age slider to `pets.html` that appears when a single pet is evaluated. Moving the slider will dynamically update the pet's weight and ability information. I'll start by examining `pets.html` and `petAbilities.js` to implement this feature. Of course. I'll add an age slider for the single pet evaluation that dynamically updates the pet's weight and abilities. Here are the changes I'll make:

1.  I'll update `pets.html` to include an age input field and a slider for ages 1-100 in the single pet view.
2.  I'll add JavaScript logic to `pets.html` to handle the new functionality. When you enter a base age and weight, moving the slider will automatically recalculate the weight for the new age and update the pet's abilities.

Of course. I've updated `pets.html` to include an age input and a slider for the single pet view. When you enter an age and weight, moving the slider will dynamically update the pet's age, recalculate its weight based on the initial values, and refresh the ability information.

When I choose to compare two pets/ages, the "Pet Mutation" from the single pet option remains visible. See attached.

You are right! That's a UI bug. When comparing pets, the single pet mutation dropdown should not be visible. I'll fix that.
