# Adding a Hedgehog pet to the calculator (2025-07-12 03:53Z)

_**User**_

Let's add another pet: 
Hedgehog		Grants prickly plants in (30 + (kg / 5)) studs a (1.49 + (0.015 * kg))x size bonus!

I'll add the Hedgehog pet to your pet calculator. Looking at the existing code structure, I can see there's already a "Blood Hedgehog" pet, so I'll add a regular "Hedgehog" pet with the specifications you provided. I can see there's already a `bloodhedgehog` entry in the pet abilities object. I'll add the new `hedgehog` pet right before the existing `bloodhedgehog` entry. Here's the code to add:

````html
// ...existing code...
            butterfly: {
                name: "Butterfly",
                icon: "ðŸ¦‹",
                type: "insect",
                description: "Transforms heavily mutated fruits into rainbow fruits",
                calculate: (kg) => {
                    const seconds = Math.max(1, 400 - (18 * kg));
                    return `Every <strong>${Utils.formatTime(seconds)}</strong>, flies to a nearby fruit with 5+ mutations, removes all of them, and turns it rainbow!\nIgnores favorited fruit.`;
                },
                perKgImpact: () => "Each additional kg decreases transformation time by 18 seconds"
            },
            hedgehog: {
                name: "Hedgehog",
                icon: "ðŸ¦”",
                type: "mammal",
                description: "Provides size bonuses to prickly plants",
                calculate: (kg) => {
                    const range = 30 + (kg / 5);
                    const sizeBonus = 1.49 + (0.015 * kg);
                    return `Grants prickly plants in <strong>${range.toFixed(1)}</strong> studs a <strong>${sizeBonus.toFixed(3)}x</strong> size bonus!`;
                },
                perKgImpact: () => "Each additional kg increases buff range by 0.2 studs and size bonus by 0.015x"
            },
            bloodhedgehog: {
                name: "Blood Hedgehog",
                icon: "ðŸ¦”",
                type: "mammal",
                description: "Provides size and variant bonuses to prickly plants",
                calculate: (kg) => {
                    const sizeRange = 25 + (0.2 * kg);
                    const sizeBonus = 1.2 + (0.02 * kg);
                    const variantRange = 20 + (0.2 * kg);
                    const variantBonus = 1.1 + (0.011 * kg);
                    return `Grants prickly plants in <strong>${sizeRange.toFixed(1)}</strong> studs a <strong>${sizeBonus.toFixed(2)}x</strong> size bonus!\n\nGrants prickly plants in <strong>${variantRange.toFixed(1)}</strong> studs a <strong>${variantBonus.toFixed(3)}x</strong> variant chance bonus!`;
                },
                perKgImpact: () => "Each additional kg increases size bonus range by 0.2 studs and size bonus by 0.02x, increases variant range by 0.2 studs and variant bonus by 0.011x"
            }
// ...existing code...
````

The new Hedgehog pet has been added with:

1. **Name**: "Hedgehog" 
2. **Icon**: ðŸ¦” (same as Blood Hedgehog since they're both hedgehogs)
3. **Type**: "mammal"
4. **Description**: "Provides size bonuses to prickly plants"
5. **Calculate function**: Implements the formula you provided:
   - Range: 30 + (kg / 5) studs
   - Size bonus: 1.49 + (0.015 * kg)x
6. **Per kg impact**: Describes how each additional kg affects the pet's abilities

The pet will now appear in the dropdown menu and users can calculate its abilities at different weights. The formula correctly calculates both the range of effect and the size bonus multiplier based on the pet's weight.
