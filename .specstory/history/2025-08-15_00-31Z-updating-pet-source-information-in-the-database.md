_**Assistant**_

I'll help you with this missing source information. Let me first understand the current structure of your pets data and then add the appropriate source information for these pets. Now let me check other relevant files to understand where pets from different categories are stored: Now let me check the specific pet files to see where these pets should be located: Now let me check the birds file for the relevant pets: Now let me check the food.js file for Mochi Mouse: Now let me check fruits.js for Blood Moon Kiwi: Based on my analysis of the files and the missing source information you provided, I need to add the source information to the existing pets. Let me update the relevant files: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
The Golden Bee already has the correct source information. Let me check the Pack Bee: Pack Bee already has the correct source. Let me update the `food.js` file for Mochi Mouse: 
```

```
Now let me update the `fruits.js` file for Blood Moon Kiwi (which should be "Blood Kiwi"): 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully updated the missing source information for all the pets you mentioned:

## Updated Pets with Source Information:

1. **Moon Cat** - Added source: "Twilight Shop", probability: 0, obtainable: false
2. **Blood Kiwi** (Blood Moon Kiwi) - Added source: "Blood Moon Shop", probability: 0, obtainable: false  
3. **Blood Hedgehog** - Added source: "Blood Moon Shop", probability: 0, obtainable: false
4. **Blood Owl** - Added source: "Blood Moon Shop", probability: 0, obtainable: false
5. **Mochi Mouse** - Added source: "Cooking Event", probability: 0, obtainable: true
6. **Bald Eagle** - Added source: "Event", probability: 0, obtainable: false

The **Golden Bee** and **Pack Bee** already had the correct source information:
- **Golden Bee**: source: "Unreleased", obtainable: false
- **Pack Bee**: source: "Crafting", obtainable: true

All pets now have complete source information including:
- Source location/method
- Probability (set to 0 for non-egg sources or special events)
- Obtainable status (true/false based on your data)

The pets are properly categorized in their respective files:
- Birds: Blood Owl, Bald Eagle
- Mammals: Moon Cat, Blood Hedgehog  
- Insects: Golden Bee, Pack Bee
- Food: Mochi Mouse
- Fruits: Blood Kiwi

Let's chance Cooking Event to just Event

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll change "Cooking Event" to just "Event" for the Mochi Mouse source. 
```

```
Done! I've changed the Mochi Mouse source from "Cooking Event" to just "Event".

Can you move all of the files in the pets folder that are not in the below list into an "Archive" folder so we can focus on the active files?
```
// Import all pet categories
import { AMPHIBIAN_PETS } from './pets/amphibians.js';
import { AQUATIC_PETS } from './pets/aquatic.js';
import { BIRD_PETS } from './pets/birds_new.js';
import { CANINES_PETS } from './pets/canines.js';
import { DINOSAUR_PETS } from './pets/dinosaurs.js';
import { DOMESTIC_PETS } from './pets/domestic.js';
import { HERBIVORE_PETS } from './pets/herbivores.js';
import { INSECT_PETS } from './pets/insects.js';
import { MAMMAL_PETS } from './pets/mammals.js';
import { MOLLUSK_PETS } from './pets/mollusks.js';
import { MYTHICAL_PETS } from './pets/mythical.js';
import { OTHER_PETS } from './pets/other.js';
import { PRIMATES_PETS } from './pets/primates.js';
import { SMALL_MAMMALS_PETS } from './pets/smallMammals.js';
import { SPECIALTY_PETS } from './pets/specialty.js';
import { UNDEAD_PETS } from './pets/undead.js';
import { WILD_ANIMALS_PETS } from './pets/wildAnimals.js';
```

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you organize the pets folder by moving inactive files to an Archive folder. Let me first check what files are currently in the pets folder and then move the ones not in your active list. Now let me identify which files are active (from your import list) and which should be archived:

**Active files (should stay):**
- amphibians.js
- aquatic.js
- birds_new.js
- canines.js
- dinosaurs.js
- domestic.js
- herbivores.js
- `insects.js`
- `mammals.js`
- mollusks.js
- mythical.js
- other.js
- primates.js
- smallMammals.js
- specialty.js
- undead.js
- wildAnimals.js

**Files to archive:**
- amphibians_corrupted_backup.js
- amphibians_restored.js
- aquatic_clean.js
- aquatic_fixed.js
- `birds.js` (replaced by birds_new.js)
- dragon.js
- `food.js`
- `fruits.js`
- fruits_corrupted_backup.js
- fruits_restored.js
- herbivores_corrupted_backup.js
- herbivores_restored.js
- insects_corrupted_backup.js
- insects_restored.js
- mammals_corrupted_backup.js
- mammals_restored.js
- mollusks_corrupted_backup.js
- mollusks_restored.js
- reptiles.js
- spirit.js

Let me create the Archive folder and move these files: Now I'll move each file to the Archive folder: Let me verify what files are now in the pets folder and the Archive folder: Perfect! I've successfully organized your pets folder. Here's what was accomplished:

## ‚úÖ Folder Organization Complete

**Active files remaining in `` folder (17 files):**
- amphibians.js
- aquatic.js  
- birds_new.js
- canines.js
- dinosaurs.js
- domestic.js
- herbivores.js
- `insects.js`
- `mammals.js`
- mollusks.js
- mythical.js
- other.js
- primates.js
- smallMammals.js
- specialty.js
- undead.js
- wildAnimals.js

**Archived files moved to `` folder (20 files):**
- All `*_corrupted_backup.js` files
- All `*_restored.js` files  
- Legacy files: birds.js, dragon.js, food.js, fruits.js, reptiles.js, spirit.js
- Clean/fixed variants: aquatic_clean.js, aquatic_fixed.js

Your pets folder is now clean and focused only on the 17 active pet category files that match your import statements in `petAbilities_modular.js`. All the backup, restored, and legacy files are safely stored in the Archive folder for future reference if needed.

Great. Now scan the files in the pets folder and see which pets are missing a source.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll scan all the pet files in the pets folder to identify which pets are missing source information. Let me check each file systematically. Now let me check each file individually to find pets that are missing the source field entirely. Let me examine each file: Based on my analysis of all the pet files in the pets folder, I found the pets that are **missing source information**. Here's the comprehensive list:

## üîç Pets Missing Source Information

- **`mammals.js`** - All pets have sources ‚úì  
- **`birds_new.js`** - All pets have sources ‚úì
- **`mollusks.js`** - All pets have sources ‚úì

## üìä Summary
- **Total pets missing sources: 19 pets**
- **Files needing source updates: 7 files**
- **Files with complete sources: 10 files**

Would you like me to add source information to these missing pets? I'll need to know what sources should be assigned to each of them.

---

_**User**_

* Dog is in mammals and complete, should be removed from canines.js
* Cow is in mammals and complete, should be removed from domestic.js
* Bunny is in herbivores and complete, should be removed from smallMammals.js
* Hedgehog is in mammals and complete, should be removed from smallMammals.js
* Mole is in mammals and complete, should be removed from smallMammals.js
* Meerkat is in mammals and complete, should be removed from wildAnimals.js
* Golden Lab is in mammals and complete, should be removed from wildAnimals.js
* Orange Tabby is in mammals and complete, should be removed from wildAnimals.js

Process these removals, then we will address the pets that are actually missing a source.

_**Assistant**_

I'll remove the duplicate pets from their respective files since they already exist complete in the `mammals.js` file. Let me process each removal: 
```

```
I can see the cow entry in `domestic.js` that needs to be removed since it exists complete in mammals.js. Let me remove it while preserving the chicken and pig entries: 
```

```
Now let me read `smallMammals.js` to remove the Bunny, Hedgehog, and Mole entries: I need to remove Bunny (exists in herbivores.js), Hedgehog (exists in mammals.js), and Mole (exists in mammals.js) while keeping hamster and squirrel. Let me do this systematically: 
```

```

```

```
