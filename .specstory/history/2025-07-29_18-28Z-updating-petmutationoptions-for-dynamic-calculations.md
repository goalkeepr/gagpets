# Updating petMutationOptions for dynamic calculations (2025-07-29 18:28Z)

_**User**_

Look at this reference code:
```
        calculate: (kg, modifierType = "none") => {
            if (!Utils.isValidWeight(kg)) return "Invalid weight";
            
            const { value: modifier, text: modifierText, style: modifierStyle } = getModifierDetails(modifierType);
            
            const baseSeconds = 1260;
            const secondsMod = baseSeconds * modifier;
            const adjustedBaseSeconds = baseSeconds - secondsMod;
            const seconds = Math.max(1, adjustedBaseSeconds - (3.6 * kg));
            const chakraChance = 20 + (kg / 5);
            
            const displayText = modifier > 0 ? ` <span style='${modifierStyle}'>${modifierText}</span>` : "";
            
            return `Every <strong>${Utils.formatTime(seconds)}</strong>, launches cursed energy at 9 different fruits. Each fruit has <strong>${chakraChance.toFixed(2)}%</strong> to mutate with <span style="color: rgb(0, 85, 255);">Corrupt Chakra</span> with a very rare chance for <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255);">Corrupt Foxfire Chakra</span> instead!${displayText}`;
```

Update the petMutationOptions (line 2863-2964) to reflect this pattern and fix the issue with the numeric values not being calculated or used.

I'll first examine the current petMutationOptions section to understand the current structure and then update it to follow the reference pattern. Now I can see the current structure. The petMutationOptions are using a different pattern with States objects that define Min, Max, Base, and Scale values, but they're not actually being used in a calculate function. I need to update this to follow the reference pattern which uses a `calculate` function that takes `kg` and `modifierType` parameters and performs actual calculations.

Let me update the petMutationOptions to follow the reference pattern: 
```

```
Perfect! I've updated the `petMutationOptions` to follow the same pattern as the reference code. Here's what I changed:

1. **Replaced the static `States` structure** with a dynamic `calculate` function that takes `kg` and `modifierType` parameters
2. **Added proper calculations** for each mutation using the values from the original States (Base, Min/Max, Scale)
3. **Implemented the modifier system** using `getModifierDetails()` just like the reference code
4. **Used proper mathematical formulas** to calculate cooldowns and chances based on pet weight
5. **Added `perKgImpact` functions** to describe how each kg affects the mutation
6. **Maintained the original color styling** and descriptions while making them dynamic
7. **Added proper bounds checking** with Math.max/Math.min to respect the original Min/Max values

Key improvements:
- **Cooldowns now decrease** with pet weight (following the Scale values)
- **Chances now increase** with pet weight where applicable
- **Modifier bonuses are applied** consistently across all mutations
- **Values are properly formatted** with `Utils.formatTime()` and `.toFixed()`
- **Each mutation now has meaningful weight scaling** based on the original parameters

The mutations now work like the reference code, with actual calculated values instead of placeholder text, and they properly respond to both pet weight and modifier types.

When I pick a mutation/modifier from the dropdown, the added effect/ability text is not populating.

_**Assistant**_

I need to investigate the issue with the mutation/modifier text not populating. Let me first check the current code structure and see how the mutation descriptions are being handled. Now let me check how the `getPetMutationDescription` function is implemented in the HTML: Let me look at the Calculator object more specifically:
