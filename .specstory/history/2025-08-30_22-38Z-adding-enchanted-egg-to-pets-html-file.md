Let's add it to pets.html.

I'll help you add the Enchanted Egg to the `pets.html` file. First, let me check what's in the new enchantedEgg.js file to understand the structure, then I'll add it to the appropriate places in pets.html. Now I can see the structure of the Enchanted Egg pets. I need to add "Enchanted Egg" to the source type filters in the `pets.html` file. Looking at the current selection showing "golden", I can see I need to add the Enchanted Egg option to both the mobile dropdown and desktop button filters. First, let me add the Enchanted Egg option to the mobile dropdown: Let me check the exact format of the mobile dropdown section: I can see there are some encoding issues with the emojis. Let me read the specific section around line 48 to see the exact format: I can see the format now. Let me add the Enchanted Egg option between Dinosaur Egg and Gourmet Egg: 
```

```
Now let me add the Enchanted Egg button to the desktop filter buttons. Let me read the section around line 72: Now let me add the Enchanted Egg button between Dinosaur Egg and Gourmet Egg: 
```

```
Now I need to add the Enchanted Egg icon to the SOURCE_ICONS mapping. Let me find this section: Perfect! Let me add the Enchanted Egg icon URL between Dinosaur Egg and Gourmet Egg: 
```

```
I should also check if there's an emoji fallback section that needs updating: Let me search for the full emoji mapping section to see the complete structure: I need to add the Enchanted Egg emoji fallback. Let me add it in the appropriate place: 
```

```
Finally, I should check if there are any filter lists that need updating. Let me search for where the source types are defined: I see there's a list around line 1235. Let me check what that is: I need to add Enchanted Egg to this list. Let me add it in alphabetical/logical order: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully added "Enchanted Egg" to the `pets.html` file in all the necessary places:

## Summary of Changes Made:

✅ **Mobile Dropdown Filter**: Added `<option value="Enchanted Egg">✨ Enchanted Egg</option>` to the mobile select dropdown

✅ **Desktop Filter Buttons**: Added the Enchanted Egg button with proper icon placeholder: `<button type="button" class="filter-btn" data-type="Enchanted Egg"><span class="source-icon-placeholder" data-source="Enchanted Egg"></span>Enchanted</button>`

✅ **SOURCE_ICONS Mapping**: Added the icon URL mapping: `'Enchanted Egg': 'https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/growagarden/images/6/6b/EnchantedEgg.png'`

✅ **Emoji Fallback**: Added the sparkles emoji fallback: `'Enchanted Egg': '✨'`

✅ **Known Sources List**: Added 'Enchanted Egg' to the knownSources array for proper filtering functionality

The Enchanted Egg source type is now fully integrated into the `pets.html` filter system and will work with both mobile dropdown and desktop button interfaces. Users will be able to filter pets by "Enchanted Egg" source type, and the proper icon (or ✨ emoji fallback) will be displayed.

The pets in the enchanted egg aren't appearing on the page.

Let me investigate why the Enchanted Egg pets aren't appearing on the page. I need to check how the pets data is loaded and integrated into the HTML. I can see the `pets.html` file is expecting a `petAbilities` object to be loaded. Let me check what script is importing the pet data: The pet data is loaded through `global_bridge.js`. Let me check that file to see how it imports the pet data: Now I need to check `petAbilities_modular.js` to see if it's importing the Enchanted Egg pets:
