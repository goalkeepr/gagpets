Let's add a new pet:
Blood Hedgehog - Grants prickly plants in (30 + (kg / 5)) studs a (2 + (kg / 50))x size bonus! Grant prickly plants in (22+(kg/5)) studs a (1.15 + (kg / 90))x variant chance bonus!

I'll add the Blood Hedgehog pet to your pet calculator. Looking at the existing pet data structure, I'll add it to the `petAbilities` object with the appropriate calculations.
