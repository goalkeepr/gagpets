# Updating Blood Kiwi with dual abilities (2025-09-12 05:02Z)

_**User (2025-09-12 05:06Z)**_

Update blood kiwi to include a second ability. Refer to Lobster Thermidor for an example of a pet with two abilities.
```
		Description = "Increases egg hatch speed by <Multiplier>%!";
		States = {
			Multiplier = {
				Base = 20;
				Scale = 0.2;
			};
		};
    ```

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

I'll help you update the Blood Kiwi pet to include a second ability. Let me first examine the current Blood Kiwi implementation and the Lobster Thermidor example you referenced. Now let me look at the Lobster Thermidor implementation to understand the dual ability pattern: Now I understand the pattern. I need to check what utils are available for validation and formatting: Perfect! Now I'll update the Blood Kiwi pet to include a dual ability. Based on the pattern from Lobster Thermidor and the provided code snippet, I'll add an egg hatch speed boost as the second ability. 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully updated the Blood Kiwi pet to include a dual ability. Here's what I changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **Updated Description**: Changed from "Reduces egg hatch times" to "Dual ability: Reduces egg hatch times and increases egg hatch speed"

2. **Added Second Ability**: Implemented the egg hatch speed multiplier based on your provided code snippet:
   - Base multiplier: 20%
   - Scale: 0.2% per kg
   - Applied modifier support for consistency

3. **Enhanced Calculate Function**: 
   - Kept the original hatch time reduction ability intact
   - Added the new hatch speed multiplier calculation
   - Updated the return string to show both abilities in a "Dual Ability" format, following the Lobster Thermidor pattern

4. **Updated Per-Kg Impact**: Extended the description to include the new hatch speed scaling

## The Updated Blood Kiwi Now:

- **First Ability**: Every 60s (minus kg), reduces the highest egg's hatch time by 45 + (0.45 × kg) seconds
- **Second Ability**: Provides a constant 20% + (0.2% × kg) increase to egg hatch speed
- **Scaling**: Each kg decreases action time, increases hatch time reduction, AND increases the hatch speed multiplier

The implementation follows the same dual ability pattern as Lobster Thermidor, with proper modifier support and formatted output that clearly shows both abilities to users.

Update Nihonzaru. It no longer has an ability. Just have the description say, "Just takes up space in your inventory. Does nothing."

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

I'll update the Nihonzaru pet to remove its ability and change the description as requested. Now I'll update the Nihonzaru pet to remove its ability and change the description: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully updated the Nihonzaru pet as requested. Here's what I changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **Updated Description**: Changed from "Bathes in hot springs to boost all pets' passive abilities" to "Just takes up space in your inventory. Does nothing."

2. **Simplified Calculate Function**: 
   - Removed all the complex calculation logic
   - Now simply returns "This pet does nothing."
   - No longer validates weight or applies modifiers since it has no ability

3. **Updated Per-Kg Impact**: Changed from "Each additional kg increases all pets' passive boost by 0.1%" to "Does nothing regardless of weight"

The Nihonzaru pet now accurately reflects that it has no functionality - it's essentially a decorative pet that serves no purpose other than taking up inventory space. The calculate function will always return the same message regardless of weight or modifier type, making it clear to users that this pet provides no benefits.

Update the silvermonkey ability:
```
		Description = "<Chance>% chance to refund fruit back to your inventory. Rarer plants have lower chance to refund!";
		States = {
			Chance = {
				Max = 20;
				Base = 7.5;
				Scale = 0.075;
			};
		};

---

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

I'll update the Silver Monkey's ability to implement the fruit refund mechanic as specified in your code snippet. 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully updated the Silver Monkey's ability based on your specifications. Here's what I changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **Updated Description**: Changed from "Mystical monkey with silver fur that reflects moonlight for magical bonuses" to "Refunds fruits back to inventory with higher chance for common plants"

2. **Implemented New Ability**: Replaced the XP bonus mechanic with a fruit refund system:
   - **Base chance**: 7.5%
   - **Scale**: 0.075% per kg
   - **Maximum**: 20% (capped)
   - **Special mechanic**: Rarer plants have lower refund chance

3. **Updated Calculate Function**:
   - Removed the time-based ability (every X seconds)
   - Implemented a passive percentage-based refund chance
   - Applied proper modifier support
   - Added the maximum cap of 20%

4. **Updated Per-Kg Impact**: Changed to reflect the new scaling: "Each additional kg increases refund chance by 0.075% (max 20%)"

## The Updated Silver Monkey Now:

- **Passive Ability**: Provides a chance to refund collected fruits back to inventory
- **Base Rate**: 7.5% chance at 1kg
- **Scaling**: Increases by 0.075% per additional kg
- **Maximum**: Capped at 20% refund chance
- **Rarity Factor**: The description notes that rarer plants have lower refund chances (this would be handled by the game engine)

The ability now matches the specifications from your code snippet exactly, with proper modifier support and clear user feedback about the scaling and maximum values.

Update pig:
```
		Description = "Every <Cooldown> seconds, emits an aura for <Duration> seconds granting <Multiplier>x chance for new fruit to grow as variants within <Range> studs!";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 5;
				Base = 120;
				Scale = -1;
			};
			Duration = {
				Base = 15;
				Scale = 0.15;
			};
			Range = {
				Base = 15;
				Scale = 0.15;
			};
			Multiplier = {
				Base = 2;
				Scale = 0.01;
			};
		};
    ```

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

I'll update the Pig's ability to implement the variant chance aura mechanic as specified in your code snippet. 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully updated the Pig's ability based on your specifications. Here's what I changed:

## Changes Made:

1. **Updated Description**: Changed from "Snorts around finding truffles and valuable items" to "Emits aura that boosts variant chance for new fruits"

2. **Implemented New Ability**: Replaced the truffle-finding mechanic with a variant chance aura system:
   - **Cooldown**: 120 seconds base, decreases by 1 second per kg (minimum 5 seconds)
   - **Duration**: 15 seconds base, increases by 0.15 seconds per kg
   - **Range**: 15 studs base, increases by 0.15 studs per kg
   - **Multiplier**: 2x base, increases by 0.01x per kg

3. **Updated Calculate Function**:
   - Removed the truffle finding mechanics (find chance and truffle value)
   - Implemented the aura-based variant chance system
   - Applied proper modifier support to the cooldown
   - Added all four scaling parameters as specified

4. **Updated Per-Kg Impact**: Changed to reflect all the new scaling parameters: "Each additional kg decreases cooldown by 1 second (min 5s), increases duration by 0.15 seconds, increases range by 0.15 studs, and increases variant multiplier by 0.01x"

## The Updated Pig Now:

- **Active Ability**: Periodically emits an aura that boosts variant chance for new fruits
- **Cooldown**: Starts at 120s, decreases with weight (minimum 5s)
- **Duration**: Aura lasts 15s + (0.15s × kg)
- **Range**: Affects fruits within 15 + (0.15 × kg) studs
- **Effect**: Provides 2x + (0.01x × kg) multiplier to variant chance

The ability now matches the specifications from your code snippet exactly, transforming the pig from a truffle-hunting pet into a variant chance booster that helps players get more variant fruits within its area of effect.
