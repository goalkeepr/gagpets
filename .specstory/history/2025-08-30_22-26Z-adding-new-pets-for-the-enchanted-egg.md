# Adding new pets for the Enchanted Egg (2025-08-30 22:26Z)

_**User**_

There is a new egg - the Enchanted Egg. Here are the new pets:
```
	["Ladybug"] = {
		Icon = "";
		Source = "Enchanted Egg";
		Description = "All flower type plants grow <Multiplier>x faster!";
		Rarity = "Common";
		Probability = 50;
		States = {
			Range = {
				Max = 30;
				Base = 30;
				Scale = 0;
			};
			Multiplier = {
				Max = 4;
				Base = 1.45;
				Scale = 0.05;
			};
		};
	};		

	Pixie = {
		Icon = "";
		Source = "Enchanted Egg";
		Description = "Every <Cooldown> seconds, spreads pixie dust for <Duration>s. All plants within <Range> studs will advance growth an extra 30 seconds every second! Also makes nearby players levitate!";
		Rarity = "Rare";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 100;
				Base = 222;
				Scale = -2.4;
			};
			Duration = {
				Max = 30;
				Base = 15;
				Scale = 0.05;
			};
			Range = {
				Max = 30;
				Base = 15;
				Scale = 0.25;
			};
		};
	};

	Imp = {
		Icon = "";
		Source = "Enchanted Egg";
		Description = "Every 6:66m, the Imp will playfully invite you to chase it. Catching the Imp will grant a random reward! The Imp has a <Chance>% to play again on successful chase!";
		Rarity = "Legendary";
		States = {
			Chance = {
				Max = 30;
				Base = 15;
				Scale = 0.05;
			};
		};
	};		


	["Glimmering Sprite"] = {
		Icon = "";
		Source = "Enchanted Egg";
		Description = "Every <Cooldown> seconds, flies to a nearby fruit and enchants it, applying Glimmering mutation!";
		Rarity = "Mythical";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 60;
				Base = 220;
				Scale = -1;
			};
		};
	};

	Cockatrice = {
		Description = "Every <Cooldown> seconds, screeches and all fruits within <Range> studs have a <Chance>% chance to turn Silver; <GoldChance>% chance to turn Gold!";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 400;
				Base = 1000;
				Scale = -5;
			};
			Range = {
				Max = 40;
				Base = 20;
				Scale = 0.25;
			};
			Chance = {
				Max = 40;
				Base = 20;
				Scale = 0.05;
			};
			GoldChance = {
				Max = 3;
				Base = 1;
				Scale = 0.01;
			};
		};
	
		Description = "Every <Cooldown> seconds, spits at <Amount> different fruit/eggs/pets. Fruits get Toxic mutation, eggs advance by <AmountEgg> seconds, pets gain <AmountXP> XP.";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 180;
				Base = 625;
				Scale = -3.5;
			};
			Amount = {
				Max = 10;
				Base = 5;
				Scale = 0.1;
			};
			AmountEgg = {
				Max = 150;
				Base = 80;
				Scale = 0.5;
			};
			AmountXP = {
				Max = 1500;
				Base = 800;
				Scale = 2.5;
			};
		};
	};
```

Note that the cockatrice has two abilities. You can use the lobster thermador in chestsventsOther.js as an example of how to implement that.

I'll help you create the Enchanted Egg pet file with the new pets. Let me first examine the structure of the existing `chestsEventsOther.js` file to understand the format, and then create the new file for the Enchanted Egg pets. Let me examine the structure of the existing pets file to understand the format better: Let me also check the beginning of the file to see the import structure: Now I'll create the enchanted egg pets file with all the pets from the specifications. Let me create a todo list first to organize this work: Now I'll create the basic structure for the enchanted egg pets file: Now I'll add the Ladybug pet: 
```

```
Now I'll add the Pixie pet: 
```

```
Now I'll add the Imp pet: 
```

```
Now I'll add the Glimmering Sprite pet: 
```

```
Now I'll add the Cockatrice pet with dual abilities, following the pattern of the Lobster Thermidor: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully created the `enchantedEgg.js` file with all the new pets from the Enchanted Egg. Here's a summary of what I implemented:

## Enchanted Egg Pets Created:

1. **Ladybug** (Common, 50% probability)
   - Passive ability that makes all flower type plants within 30 studs grow faster
   - Growth multiplier starts at 1.45x and increases by 0.05x per kg (max 4x)

2. **Pixie** (Rare)
   - Active ability that spreads pixie dust every 222s (decreases by 2.4s per kg, min 100s)
   - Advances plant growth by 30 seconds per second and makes players levitate
   - Duration and range scale with kg

3. **Imp** (Legendary)
   - Unique chase minigame every 6:66 minutes
   - Grants random rewards when caught
   - Chance to play again increases with kg (0.05% per kg, max 30%)

4. **Glimmering Sprite** (Mythical)
   - Active ability that applies Glimmering mutation to nearby fruits
   - Cooldown decreases by 1s per kg (min 60s)

5. **Cockatrice** (Mythical, dual ability)
   - **Screech**: Turns fruits Silver/Gold within range
   - **Spit**: Applies Toxic mutations to fruits, advances eggs, and gives XP to pets
   - Complex scaling with multiple parameters for both abilities

The file follows the same structure and patterns as the existing `chestsEventsOther.js` file, including:
- Proper imports for utilities and constants
- Modifier support for enhanced calculations
- Detailed `calculate` functions with kg scaling
- Comprehensive `perKgImpact` descriptions
- Proper min/max limits where specified

All pets are marked as `obtainable: true` and use appropriate emoji fallbacks for their icons. The Cockatrice implementation follows the dual-ability pattern from the Lobster Thermidor example, with separate calculations for each ability combined into a single description.

I have received additional data that was missing originally:
```
Ladybug
	Icon = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/growagarden/images/3/38/Ladybug.png";
	Probability = 50;
Pixie:
	Icon = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/growagarden/images/2/22/Pixie.png";
	Probability = 29;
Imp:
	Icon = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/growagarden/images/b/b3/Imp.png";
	Probability = 15;
Glimmering Sprite:
	Icon = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/growagarden/images/a/a1/Glimmering_Sprite.png";
	Probability = 5;
Cockatrice:
	Icon = "https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/growagarden/images/0/09/Cockatrice.png";
	Probability = 1;
```

I'll update the enchanted egg pets with the correct icons and probabilities from the additional data you provided. 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Perfect! I've updated all the Enchanted Egg pets with the correct icons and probabilities:

## Updated Pet Data:

1. **Ladybug** - Icon updated to the official Ladybug image, probability confirmed at 50%
2. **Pixie** - Icon updated to the official Pixie image, probability set to 29%
3. **Imp** - Icon updated to the official Imp image, probability set to 15%
4. **Glimmering Sprite** - Icon updated to the official Glimmering Sprite image, probability set to 5%
5. **Cockatrice** - Icon updated to the official Cockatrice image, probability set to 1%

All pets now have their proper wiki image URLs from the Grow a Garden wiki, while maintaining their emoji fallbacks. The probabilities total 100% (50 + 29 + 15 + 5 + 1), which makes sense for an egg drop system.
