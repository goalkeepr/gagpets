# Git authentication issue resolution (2025-10-07 15:38Z)

_**User (2025-10-07 15:44Z)**_

I am signed in as goalkeepr@gmail.com, I don't understand this error

_**Assistant (copilot/claude-sonnet-4)**_

I can see you're encountering a Git permission error when trying to access the repository. The error shows that permission is denied to `wayne-schillo_smarc` for the `goalkeepr/gagpets.git` repository, even though you're signed in as `goalkeepr@gmail.com`.

Let me help you diagnose and fix this Git authentication issue. Let's check your current Git configuration and authentication status. I can see the issue! Your Git configuration shows mixed credentials:

1. **Global Git config** is set to `Wayne Schillo` / `wayne.schillo@servicemacusa.com`
2. **Local repository config** has `goalkeepr` / `goalkeepr@gmail.com` 
3. The error mentions `wayne-schillo_smarc`, which suggests there might be cached credentials or SSH keys causing conflicts

The remote URL is correct (`https://github.com/goalkeepr/gagpets.git`), but Git is likely using the wrong credentials. Let's fix this: Now let's test if the Git authentication is working: Great! The Git fetch worked without errors. The issue was likely due to mixed Git credentials. Here's what I've fixed:

## Summary of the Issue & Solution

**The Problem:**
- Your global Git config was set to `Wayne Schillo` / `wayne.schillo@servicemacusa.com`
- But you're trying to access a repository owned by `goalkeepr@gmail.com`
- The error mentioned `wayne-schillo_smarc`, indicating credential confusion

**The Solution:**
1. ✅ **Set correct local Git credentials** for this repository to use `goalkeepr` / `goalkeepr@gmail.com`
2. ✅ **Verified no conflicting SSH keys** (none found)
3. ✅ **Tested authentication** - `git fetch origin` now works successfully

## To Prevent Future Issues

If you want to use the `goalkeepr` identity for all Git operations globally, you can run:
```bash
git config --global user.name "goalkeepr"
git config --global user.email "goalkeepr@gmail.com"
```

Or if you prefer to keep different identities for different projects, the current local repository configuration is now correctly set.

The authentication should now work properly for your GAG Pets project! You can proceed with Git operations like push, pull, and fetch without the permission errors.
