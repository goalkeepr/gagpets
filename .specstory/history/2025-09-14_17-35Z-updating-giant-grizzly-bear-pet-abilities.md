# Updating Giant Grizzly Bear pet abilities (2025-09-14 17:35Z)

_**User (2025-09-14 17:36Z)**_

Update Giant Grizzly Bear:
```
		Description = "Every <Cooldown>m, <Chance>% chance a nearby fruit gets the Fall mutation!";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 30;
				Base = 140;
				Scale = -2;
				Formatter = "ColonTime";
			};
			Chance = {
				Max = 45;
				Base = 20;
				Scale = 0.2;
			};
		};

		Description = "Grants <Chance>% increased player size!";
		States = {
			Chance = {
				Max = 32;
				Base = 16;
				Scale = 0.2;
			};
		};
    ```

I'll update the Giant Grizzly Bear pet with the new values based on the specifications you provided. Let me analyze the current implementation and make the necessary changes. 
```

```
I've successfully updated the Giant Grizzly Bear pet with the new specifications:

**Changes made:**

1. **Fall Mutation Ability:**
   - Base cooldown: 240s → 140s
   - Base chance: 10% → 20%
   - Max chance: 30% → 45%
   - Scale rate: 0.1% → 0.2% per kg

2. **Player Size Increase Ability:**
   - Base chance: 8% → 16%
   - Max chance: 16% → 32%
   - Scale rate: 0.1% → 0.2% per kg

3. **Updated perKgImpact description** to reflect the new scaling values and maximum limits.

The pet now has a significantly faster cooldown for applying Fall mutations (starting at 2 minutes 20 seconds instead of 4 minutes), higher base chances for both abilities, and doubled scaling rates, making it much more powerful as pets gain weight.

Update Giant Barn Owl:
```
		Description = "Pets bought directly from shops have a bonus 0.1 - <Chance> KG to their base weight! (Max 3 KG).";
		States = {
			Chance = {
				Max = 0.8;
				Base = 0.36;
				Scale = 0.04;
			};
		};

		Description = "All active Fall type pets gain an additional <Chance> XP/s!";
		States = {
			Chance = {
				Max = 4;
				Base = 1.2;
				Scale = 0.12;
			};
		};
```

Update Giant Swan:
```
		Description = "Every <Cooldown> seconds, goes to another player''s pet and befriends it and performs its ability!";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 300;
				Base = 790;
				Scale = -4.5;
			};
		};

		Description = "Every <Cooldown> seconds, graces a fruit with Graceful mutation!";
		States = {
			Cooldown = {
				Min = 65;
				Base = 150;
				Scale = -3.5;
			};
		};

I've successfully updated the Giant Swan pet with the new specifications:

**Changes made:**

1. **Befriend Other Players' Pets Ability:**
   - Base cooldown: 1500s (25:00) → 790s (13:10)
   - Min cooldown: 750s (12:30) → 300s (5:00)

I'll add these five new pets to the end of the chestsEventsOther.js file, converting them from the provided format to match the existing pet structure in the codebase. 
```

```
I've successfully added all five new pets to the end of the `chestsEventsOther.js` file. Here's a summary of what was added:

## New Pets Added:

1. **Red Squirrel** (Rare)
   - Reduces Fall type pet cooldowns by 14-30 seconds when they finish abilities
   - Scales by 0.4s per kg

2. **Chipmunk** (Rare) 
   - 6-12% chance to not consume harvest tool uses
   - Scales by 0.25% per kg

3. **Marmot** (Legendary)
   - Burrows underground every 540s (min 120s) with 15-30% chance to burrow again
   - Provides Fall-related rewards when found
   - Scales by -3.5s cooldown and +0.05% re-burrow chance per kg

4. **Sugar Glider** (Mythical)
   - Glides between 3 fruits every 1200s (min 720s) to copy and transfer mutations
   - Scales by -4.5s per kg

5. **Space Squirrel** (Divine)
   - 15-25% chance to apply Voidtouched mutation every 1080s (min 540s)
   - Scales by -4.5s cooldown and +0.3% chance per kg

All pets have been converted to match the existing codebase structure with proper:
- ES6 module format
- Modifier support using `getModifierDetails()`
- Weight validation with `Utils.isValidWeight()`
- Time formatting with `Utils.formatTime()`
- HTML-formatted return strings
- Appropriate fallback emojis and mammal type classification
- Source set to "Fall Pet Shop" with obtainable: true
