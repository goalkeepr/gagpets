I have this list of pets and their special abilities from an online game called Grow a Garden:
```
Pet	Ability
Bunny	Every (45 - kg) seconds, eats a carrot for a (1.5 + (0.015 * kg)) value bonus!
Starfish	Wanders in the garden and gains (5 + (kg / 2)) experience points, making it grow older. Best for opening pet slots.
Crab	Every (377 - (3.8 * kg)) seconds, goes to another random player and pinches them for their money and grants you (225 + (25 * kg)) sheckles.
Bee	Every (1510 - (16 * kg)) seconds, flies to a nearby fruit and pollinates it, applying Pollinated mutation!
Rooster	Increases egg hatch speed by (20 + (kg / 5))%
Sea Turtle	Every (10.6 - (10 / 120 * kg)) minutes, grants (990 + (15 * kg)) bonus experience!
Blood Kiwi	Every (60 - kg) seconds, goes to the egg with the highest hatch time, and reduces its hatch time by (45 + (0.45 * kg)) seconds!
Ostrich	Pets hatched from eggs have a bonus 1 to (4.5 + (kg / 2)) age to their age value!
Capybara	All pets within (15.5 + (kg / 4)) studs won't lose hunger and will gain (3 + (0.3 * kg)) XP every second!
Raptor	(2+(kg / 5))% chance fruit gets Amber mutation after collecting. Rarer plants have lesser chance. Grants additional (14+(kg / 4))% increase to player movement speed!
Stegosaurus	(8 + (0.15 * kg)) chance harvested fruit duplicates! Rarer crops have lower chance to duplicate. (5 + (kg / 10)) extra chance for Prehistoric type fruit to duplicate!
Brown Mouse	Every (502-(5.89* kg)) seconds, gains additional (750 + (11 * kg)) bonus experience! Grants additional (12 + (kg / 10))% increase to player jump height!
Snail	(5 + (kg / 20))% extra chance harvested plants drop seeds. Rarer plants have lower chance to duplicate.
Giant Ant	(1.5 + (2 * kg)) chance Harvested fruit duplicate! Rarer crops have lower chance to duplicate. (5 + (0.15 * kg)) extra chance for Candy type fruit to duplicate!
Raccoon	Every (904 - (4 * kg)) seconds, goes to another plot and duplicates a random crop and gives it to you!
Disco Bee	Every (905 - (12 * kg)), (14 + kg)% chance a nearby fruit becomes disco!
```
I want to create a webpage where a user can select a pet type from a dropdown, enter that pets weight in kg, and have the ability displayed, with the correct calculation based on that weight.

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you create a webpage for calculating pet abilities in the Grow a Garden game. Let me start by examining the workspace structure and then create a modern, interactive webpage. Let me check if there are any existing files in the workspace: Now I'll create a modern, responsive webpage for the pet ability calculator. I'll create an HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript for a complete solution: Perfect! I've created a beautiful and interactive pet ability calculator webpage for the Grow a Garden game. Here's what I've built:

## Features:

1. **Modern Design**: Clean, responsive design with a gradient background and smooth animations
2. **Pet Selection**: Dropdown menu with all 16 pets, each with appropriate emoji icons
3. **Real-time Calculations**: Updates results instantly as you type or change selections
4. **Accurate Formulas**: All pet abilities are calculated exactly according to your specifications
5. **Responsive Layout**: Works perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices
6. **Error Handling**: Validates input and provides helpful error messages

## Key Components:

- **Pet Dropdown**: All pets with emoji icons for easy identification
- **Weight Input**: Number input field that accepts decimal values
- **Real-time Updates**: Calculations update automatically when you change pet or weight
- **Beautiful Results Display**: Shows the pet name, weight, and calculated ability description
- **Smooth Animations**: Fade-in effects and hover animations for better user experience

## How to Use:

1. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser
2. Select a pet from the dropdown menu
3. Enter the pet's weight in kilograms
4. The ability will be calculated and displayed automatically

The calculator handles all the mathematical formulas correctly, including:
- Time calculations (ensuring non-negative values)
- Percentage calculations
- Experience point bonuses
- Distance calculations (studs)
- And all other special ability modifiers

You can now test the calculator by opening the file in your browser. Try different pets and weights to see how their abilities scale!

Let's make these 2 updates:
1. Times are always rounded to the nearest whole second
2. Times greater than 60 seconds are displayed as "X minutes, Y seconds"

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the JavaScript to round times to whole seconds and display longer times in a minutes and seconds format. Let me modify the calculation functions: 
```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```

```
Perfect! I've updated the pet ability calculator with the two requested changes:

## Changes Made:

1. **Times are now rounded to the nearest whole second**: Added a `formatTime()` helper function that uses `Math.round()` to ensure all times are displayed as whole seconds.

2. **Times greater than 60 seconds are displayed as "X minutes, Y seconds"**: The `formatTime()` function now converts longer durations into a more readable format:
   - 65 seconds → "1 minute, 5 seconds"
   - 120 seconds → "2 minutes"
   - 90 seconds → "1 minute, 30 seconds"
   - 45 seconds → "45 seconds"

The function also handles proper pluralization (e.g., "1 minute" vs "2 minutes", "1 second" vs "2 seconds").

## Updated Pets:
The following pets that have time-based abilities now use the new formatting:
- **Bunny**: Carrot eating frequency
- **Crab**: Money pinching frequency  
- **Bee**: Pollination frequency
- **Blood Kiwi**: Egg hatch time reduction frequency
- **Brown Mouse**: Experience gain frequency
- **Raccoon**: Crop duplication frequency
- **Disco Bee**: Disco fruit creation frequency

**Note**: The Sea Turtle ability is already displayed in minutes (not seconds), so it wasn't changed as it doesn't need the seconds-to-minutes conversion.

Now when you test the calculator, you'll see much more readable time formats like "15 minutes, 30 seconds" instead of "930.0 seconds"!

Update sea turtle ability to: 

Every (660 - (8.5 * kg) seconds, grants (990 + (15 * kg)) bonus experience! Every (164 - (3 * kg)) seconds, splashes water at a nearby fruit and it has a (12 + (0.2 * kg))% chance to become Wet!

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the Sea Turtle ability with the new formula that includes both the experience bonus and the water splash ability. 
```

```
Perfect! I've updated the Sea Turtle ability with the new formula. The changes include:

## Updated Sea Turtle Ability:

1. **Experience Bonus**: Every `(660 - (8.5 * kg))` seconds, grants `(990 + (15 * kg))` bonus experience
2. **Water Splash**: Every `(164 - (3 * kg))` seconds, splashes water at a nearby fruit with a `(12 + (0.2 * kg))%` chance to become Wet

The Sea Turtle now has two separate time-based abilities:
- A longer cooldown for the experience bonus
- A shorter cooldown for the water splash ability that can make fruits "Wet"

Both time calculations now use the `formatTime()` function, so they'll be displayed in the proper "X minutes, Y seconds" format when the times are 60 seconds or longer, and as whole seconds when shorter.

For example, with a 10kg Sea Turtle:
- Experience bonus: Every `(660 - 85) = 575` seconds = "9 minutes, 35 seconds"
- Water splash: Every `(164 - 30) = 134` seconds = "2 minutes, 14 seconds"
- Wet chance: `(12 + 2) = 14.0%`

Display all percentages to 2 decimal places. Display all numbers greater than 999 with a comma (like 1,234).

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the code to display all percentages to 2 decimal places and format numbers greater than 999 with commas. Let me add a helper function for number formatting and update all the pet calculations. 
```

```
Now I'll update all the pet calculations to use proper formatting: 
```

```
