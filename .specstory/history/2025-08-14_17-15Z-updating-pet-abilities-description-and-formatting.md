# Updating pet abilities description and formatting (2025-08-14 17:15Z)

I am thinking of replacing the "Per Kg Impact" section with something like the attached. Also, adding the minimum value to the description. What do you think?

The value for Golden/Small Toy is baseSeconds * 0.1
The value for Rainbow/Medium Toy is baseSeconds * 0.2

Please overlook my terrible formatting, I am not a designer.

I think that's a great idea. It makes the ability's scaling clearer. I'll go ahead and update the `dog` pet's `perKgImpact` description in `petAbilities.js` to include the minimum digging time.

I've updated the `dog` pet's "Per Kg Impact" section in `petAbilities.js` as you suggested.

1.  I've added the minimum digging time to the description.
2.  I've replaced the simple text with a more informative HTML table that breaks down the cooldown reduction for Golden/Small Toy and Rainbow/Medium Toy modifiers.

I think this new format is much clearer and provides more useful information at a glance. Let me know what you think of the changes
