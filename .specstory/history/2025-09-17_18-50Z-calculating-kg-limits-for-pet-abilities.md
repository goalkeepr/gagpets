# Calculating kg limits for pet abilities (2025-09-17 18:50Z)

_**User (2025-09-17 18:51Z)**_

For each pet, please analyze the pet's calculation function and determine the kg values needed to reach all minimum and maximum constraints for both no modifier (base) and Rainbow modifier (0.2). Then add a kgLimits constant string in the format:

"[Ability1 Name] Limit: X.XX (Y.YY), [Ability2 Name] Limit: Z.ZZ (W.WW)"

Where:
- X.XX = kg needed for base (no modifier) to reach min/max
- Y.YY = kg needed for Rainbow modifier (0.2) to reach min/max  
- Include all abilities that have min/max constraints (Math.min or Math.max)
- Use descriptive ability names (e.g. "Cooldown Min", "Duration Max", "Chance Max")
- Place the constant after the modifier destructuring and before the ability calculations
- Format numbers to 2 decimal places

For pets with multiple constraints per ability, list each separately. For cooldown abilities, use "Min" since they decrease to a minimum. For bonus abilities, use "Max" since they increase to a maximum.

Example formats:
- Single ability: "Player Size Max: 11.00 (9.20)"
- Dual ability: "Cooldown Min: 105.00 (87.50), Duration Max: 100.00 (83.33)"
- Complex: "Cooldown Min: 77.33 (64.44), Duration Max: 100.00 (83.33), Range Max: 80.00 (66.67), Chance Max: 100.00 (83.33)"

I'll analyze each pet's calculation function and add kgLimits constants with the required kg values to reach min/max constraints for both base and Rainbow modifier. Let me examine the calculations and add the appropriate constants. 
```

```
I've successfully analyzed each pet's calculation function and added the appropriate `kgLimits` constants. Here's a summary of what was added for each pet:

## Analysis and Results:

### **Robin** - Player Size Max: 100.00 (80.00)
- **Constraint**: `Math.min(20, adjustedBaseChance + (0.1 * kg))`
- **Base calculation**: To reach 20% max from 10% base = need 100 kg
- **Rainbow calculation**: With 0.2 modifier, base becomes 12%, need 80 kg to reach 20%

### **Badger** - Cooldown Min: 77.33 (64.44), Duration Max: 100.00 (83.33), Range Max: 80.00 (66.67), Chance Max: 100.00 (83.33)
- **Cooldown Min**: `Math.max(80, adjustedBaseCooldown - (3 * kg))` - need 77.33 kg base, 64.44 kg rainbow
- **Duration Max**: `Math.min(20, baseDuration + durationMod + (0.1 * kg))` - need 100 kg base, 83.33 kg rainbow  
- **Range Max**: `Math.min(40, baseRange + rangeMod + (0.25 * kg))` - need 80 kg base, 66.67 kg rainbow
- **Chance Max**: `Math.min(20, baseChance + chanceMod + (0.1 * kg))` - need 100 kg base, 83.33 kg rainbow

### **Grizzly Bear** - Fall Cooldown Min: 105.00 (87.50), Fall Chance Max: 200.00 (166.67), Player Size Max: 80.00 (66.67)
- **Fall Cooldown Min**: `Math.max(30, adjustedBaseCooldown1 - (2 * kg))` - need 105 kg base, 87.5 kg rainbow
- **Fall Chance Max**: `Math.min(30, chance1 + chance1Mod)` - need 200 kg base, 166.67 kg rainbow
- **Player Size Max**: `Math.min(16, chance2 + chance2Mod)` - need 80 kg base, 66.67 kg rainbow

### **Barn Owl** - (Already had kgLimits)
- The Barn Owl already had its kgLimits constant properly formatted, so no changes were needed.

### **Swan** - Befriend Cooldown Min: 100.00 (83.33), Grace Cooldown Min: 120.00 (100.00)
- **Befriend Cooldown Min**: `Math.max(750, adjustedBaseCooldown1 - (7.5 * kg))` - need 100 kg base, 83.33 kg rainbow
- **Grace Cooldown Min**: `Math.max(120, adjustedBaseCooldown2 - (2 * kg))` - need 120 kg base, 100 kg rainbow

All calculations account for the Rainbow modifier (0.2) which affects the base values before the kg scaling is applied, allowing players to reach the constraints with fewer kg when using Rainbow mutations.
