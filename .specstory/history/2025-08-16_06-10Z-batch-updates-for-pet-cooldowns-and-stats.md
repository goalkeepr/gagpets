Bee: Cooldown Min increased from 60.00 to 150.00
Brown Mouse: Cooldown Min increased from 10.00 to 60.00
Butterfly: Cooldown Min increased from 15.00 to 180.00
Capybara: Amount Max created at 25.00
Cat: Cooldown Min increased from 5.00 to 20.00, Range Max created at 20.00, Multiplier Max created at 4.00, Duration Max created at 20.00
Chicken Zombie: Cooldown Min increased from 10.00 to 160.00

I'll help you update the pet data in batches of 10. Let me first explore the pet data structure to understand how the cooldowns, amounts, ranges, multipliers, and durations are organized. Now let me search for these specific pets across the pet data files to understand where they're located: Let me search more specifically for the pets we need to update: Now let me read the specific files to understand the data structure for each pet that needs updating: Now let me check the `antiBeeEgg.js` file for Butterfly and Disco Bee: Now let me check for the other pets. Let me look at `mythicalEgg.js` for Brown Mouse: Let me also check `paradiseEgg.js` for Capybara: Now let me check for Cat - let me search for it: Now let me check `chestsEventsOther.js` for Chicken Zombie, Cooked Owl, and Crab: Let me also find Cooked Owl and Crab in the same file: Now let me find Crab: Finally, let me check `primalEgg.js` for Dilophosaurus: Now I have all the information I need. Let me create a plan to update all 10 pets with their new values. Let me organize this into a todo list: Now I'll start updating these pets one by one. Let me begin with the Bee: For Bee, the cooldown needs to change from 60.00 to 150.00 seconds. Looking at the current code, `baseSeconds = 1800` which equals 30 minutes at base, but with the kg reduction formula it becomes 60 seconds at minimum. To get 150 seconds minimum cooldown, I need to increase the baseSeconds to 9000 (150 * 60 = 9000 based on the pattern I see):
