Let's split the CSS into a separate file, there's a lot of CSS here.

I'll help you extract the CSS from the HTML file into a separate CSS file. Let me first examine the current HTML file to see the CSS content. Let me read the remaining part of the file to see the complete CSS content: Perfect! I can see there's a large amount of CSS embedded in the HTML file. Let me extract all the CSS into a separate file and update the HTML to reference it.

First, I'll create the CSS file: Now I'll update the HTML file to remove the embedded CSS and add a link to the external CSS file: 
```

```
Perfect! I've successfully separated the CSS from the HTML file. Here's what I've done:

## Summary of Changes

1. **Created a new CSS file**: `styles.css` - This contains all the CSS that was previously embedded in the HTML file.

2. **Updated the HTML file**: 
   - Removed the large `<style>` block (over 600 lines of CSS)
   - Added a link to the external stylesheet: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`

## Benefits of this separation:

1. **Better maintainability**: CSS is now in its own file, making it easier to manage and edit
2. **Improved performance**: The CSS can be cached separately by browsers
3. **Cleaner HTML**: The HTML file is now much more readable and focused on structure
4. **Better organization**: CSS and HTML concerns are properly separated
5. **Reusability**: The CSS file could be used by other HTML files if needed

The functionality of your pet calculator should remain exactly the same, but now the code is much better organized with a clear separation of concerns between styling (CSS) and structure/content (HTML).
